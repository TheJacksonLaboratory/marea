Until recently, treatment has continued at a relatively unsophisticated level. Although amputation, usually at a cross-bone level with a safe margin above the lesion, continues to be the treatment of choice, increased interest is being demonstrated in radical en bloc limb-saving resections. Modern joint implants are proving effective in restoring the osseous integrity and joint function after the resection.

Flow rates of oxygen into the bag were varied: 5, 10, 15, and 20 liter/min. For each flow rate, bag refill (reexpansion) times were varied: 1, 2, 4 sec. The results show that such a maneuver will effectively increase the FDO2 of the bags at all flow rates tested--in certain instances to values greater than 0.8. This maneuver would be important to resuscitation situations where it is desirable to achieve better patient oxygenation.

This system was used successfully during transportation of 6 of 11 patients who required ventilatory assistance and who were being considered for extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support. Immediately after transportation, PaCO2 values were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients ventilated with this system, when compared to PaCO2 values of the remaining 5 patients in whom ventilation was assisted with a 2-liter anesthesia bag (PaCO2 = 58.7 +/- 3.6). This system offers significant advantages over other presently manufactured systems, including low cost, portability, and efficiency in terms of oxygen utilization. (Manual ventilation is supplied so that no auxiliary electrical power supply is necessary.) Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can be varied by 2.5 cm H2O increments using a commercially available, weighted ball valve. In addition, it has been useful for transporting patients with acute respiratory failure within the hospital for therapeutic maneuvers or diagnostic studies.

The rapidity with which this occurs seems to depend on the quantity and quality of patient secretions and dumping infected water from lazy loops into the Humidifier. Following modifications to the ventilator circuit which included: (1) closed system humidifier filling, (2) the addition of a small copper trap and drainage system to the inspired side of the breathing circuit, and (3) alteration of the heater, no contamination of the humidifier contents occurred for periods as long as 28 days. This trap was manufactured in our hospital using standard plumbing fixtures; a commercial model is available. This system is applicable to any volume ventilator using a heated reservoir humidifier.

Persistent asymptomatic lesions in any portion of the oral cavity, except the lip, that were considered clinically suspicious with our previous criteria (erythroplasia), or those changes that did not correspond to the visual criteria but were found in high risk sites, were studied and biopsies were performed. Degrees of redness versus whiteness and clinical diagnoses were documented. Of 148 lesions in 113 patients, 66 were malignant (52 invasive and 14 in situ). There was a false negative diagnostic rate of 4.5% (3 of 66) and a false positive rate of 7% (4 of 57). Of the malignant lesions, 86.3% were primarily red compared with 31.9% of the benign lesions. OF the cancers, 10.7% were predominantly white as opposed to 66.7% of benign lesions. This analysis confirms our previous suppositions that persistent erythroplasia rather than leukoplakia, in high-risk sites of the oral cavity, is the earliest and predominant sign of oral carcinoma.

The rationale for oral cytology is developed and documented, and interpretations of the results are explained. Advantages and disadvantages of this technique are given and indications and contraindications for this diagnostic adjunct are discussed. A simple method involving the use of inexpensive equipment in the office is suggested.

The concept of "illness behavior" can be used to investigate this problem. Knowledge of a patient's illness behavior patterns helps enable the dentist to understand who seeks care for symptoms of facial pain and mandibular dysfunction; why the care is sought; the meaning of the symptoms to the patient; and the patient's response to treatment.

The cleanser caused a significantly (P less than .01) greater intensity and incidence (P less than .01) of inflammation. The added insult from cleanser pretreatment caused destruction of the odontoblast processes withnin the cut dentinal tubules, and an increase in diameter of the tubules. These effects on dentin and odontoblasts probably contributed to the observed increase in adverse pulp responses.

Those receiving biofeedback were able to reduce their mean masseter EMG levels significantly. Concurrently, there was a reduction of symptoms. Seventy-five percent of the successfully treated patients required no further therapy during one year of observation.

Psychologicall, the patient felt better by knowing that the mass was completely removed. Atherosclerosis should be considered when masses are found in the lips in elderly patients. It is thought that this lesion is common but has not been reported in the past.

Those authorized in 1972 and 1976 were surveyed only once, in 1972 and 1977, respectively. The response rate was always higher than 89%. Urban/rural and regional maldistribution of civilian dentists was reduced during the years 1972-1977 (Tables 1-7). The dentist/population ratio fails to allow for variation in need and demand for dental care, the use of ancillary personnel, demographic, socio-economic and cultural factors. Consequently, care should be exercised when judging the adequacy or otherwise of the supply of dentists by these results. The proportion of respondents whose place of work and home address at the start of dental studies, was the same county, increased during the observation period (Fig. 1), when in fact an opposite trend had been expected because of the progressively more difficult job situation for newly authorized dentists. It was concluded that this tendency to return "home" might be made use of in the efforts to make dental health services equally available and accessible to all citizens.

Such systems show significant cooperativity in their binding of O2: at low O2 pressures a low O2 affinity form exists, and at high O2 pressures a higher O2 affinity form develops. Direct analogies are drawn to the cooperativity shown in O2 binding by hemoglobin. These model systems mimic hemoglobin quantitatively.

The replacement of the distal valine by alanine in hemoglobin Sydney leaves a large gap inside the heme pocket, which is partly filled by a water molecule bonded to the distal histidine. Hemoglobin Sydney has the same partition coefficient between CO and O2 as hemoglobin A. Replacement of the distal histidine increases the stretching frequency of CO linked to the beta heme by 6 cm-1, but replacement of the distal valine increases it by only 3 cm-1, but replacement of the distal histidine leaves the O-O stretching frequency unchanged.

Chain termination and "plus and minus" DNA sequencing methods have been used to obtain the nucleotide sequence of these two origins. The unique origin at which the complementary DNA strand is initiated has located in the untranslated region between genes F and G. This sequence, which has considerable secondary structure, contains a stretch which is complementary to the RNA primer that is observed during synthesis in vitro of the G4 complementary DNA strand [Bouché, J.P., Rowen, L. & Kornberg, A. (1978) J. Biol. Chem., in press]. This G4 origin shows extensive sequence homology with the bacteriophage lambda origin of DNA replication [Denniston-Thompson, K., Moore, D. D., Kruger, D. E., Furth, M. E. & Blattner, F. R. (1977) Science 198, 1051-1056]. The sequence around the site in gene A at which G4 viral DNA strand synthesis is initiated by the nicking action of the cistron A protein is very similar to that of bacteriophage phiX174. An (A + T)-rich stretch flanked by (G + C)-rich sequences may be involved in the interaction between the DNA and protein.

Reduction of this bond in the native protein requires approximately 50-fold more mercaptoethanol than the reduction of the bond in the protein denatured by sodium dodecyl sulfate. An improved procedure for the formation of this disulfide bond from recombined chains is reported. A and B chains spontaneously and rapidly reassociate into a stable complex with a sedimentation velocity similar to that of native oxidized ricin before the disulfide bond reforms. The mixture of both chains also behaves on Bio-Gel P-100 like native oxidized ricin. However, the complex formed by the two chains, assayed before the disulfide bond can reform, and reduced ricin, carboxymethylated to prevent reoxidation, shows a significant decrease in toxicity to mice and a decrease in ability to inhibit protein synthesis in HeLa cells in culture.

The present paper is concerned with a number of examples of enzyme--enzyme interactions that do not belong to the class of models of the earlier papers. These are more biochemically oriented and include heterologous dimers, a linear chain with unsymmetrical interactions, and concerted isologous dimers (half-the-sites reactivity).

Although complete sequences have not been established, the following characteristics are apparent. (a) Cytoplasmic actins are the products of two different genes. The difference seen in isoelectric focusing studies is probably determined only by the nature of the three amino-terminal acidic residues. (b) Mammalian cytoplasmic actins are exceedingly similar and perhaps identical. (c) Cytoplasmic actins may differ by at least 25 amino acid replacement from rabbit muscle actin. These replacements have been identified for calf thymus actin; however, other cytoplasmic actins show the same replacements. (d) The replacements always involve-except for the first five residues-neutral amino acid residues. (e) The replacements are not randomly distributed. Residues 18-75 are constant whereas residues 2-18 and 259-298 show many substitutions. (f) The main component of smooth muscle actin from chicken gizzard shows the charge characteristics found at the amino terminus of the less acidic cytoplasmic actin species. In the rest of the polypeptide chain, gizzard actin resembles skeletal muscle actin, although two substitutions of the cytoplasmic type have been identified. (g) Heart muscle actin is very similar to skeletal muscle actin. Only two amino acid replacements have been found; they are of the cytoplasmic type. (h) Skeletal muscle actins from chicken and beef have not shown a replacement.

From rat liver nuclei that had been incubated with NAD+, histones and some nonhistone proteins were extracted with 0.25 M HCl. Approximately 60% of the ADP-ribose incorporated into 20% trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was recovered in this extract. The ADP-ribosylated material was then isolated from the extract by covalent chromatography on a borate gel column and further purified by carboxymethylcellulose column chromatography. As judged by electrophoretic mobilities in various gel systems and by amino acid compositions, approximately 50% of the ADP-ribose recovered in the carboxymethylcellulose fractions was associated with several nonhistone proteins with molecular weights of 2-6 x 10(4), while 35% aand 15% were associated with histones H2B and H1, respectively. Since the average chain length of the polymer bound to any of these proteins was less than two ADP-ribos-l units, the percentage distribution reflects the number of ADP-ribosylated sites rather than the chain length.

The 32P-labeled 19S and 26S RNA hybridized to DNA from nucleosome monomers, dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers, separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, although the level of hybridization to DNA from nucleosome fractions was less than the level of hybridization to undigested nuclear DNA. The distribution of 19S and 26S rDNA sequences in the nucleosome fractions differed from the distribution of bulk DNA in that the rDNA sequences were recovered primarily in two fractions containing monomer-sized DNA lengths (140-160 base pairs). The percentage of DNA hybridizing to 19S plus 26S RNA was greater in peak A, the more slowly sedimenting monomer peak, than in any other chromatin fraction at all stages of digestion. Peak A and monomer particles differed in protein content and distribution. The presence of ribosomal cistrons in an altered nucleosome configuration may be related to changes in functional states of rDNA chromatin.

The inhibitor is associated with a cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activity (ATP:protein phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.37) that phosphorylates the small polypeptide (38,000 daltons) of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2. Activation of the inhibitor requires ATP in addition to double-stranded RNA and is accompanied by the phosphorylation of a 67,000-dalton polypeptide of unknown function. The inhibitor remains associated with the ribosomes during high-speed sedimentation. Once formed, the ribosome-associated inhibitor phosphorylates eIF-2 and inhibits protein synthesis in the absence of double-stranded RNA. Inhibition is prevented by exogenous eIF-2. The bound inhibitor can be solubilized by extraction with 0.5 M KCl. The soluble inhibitor preparation retains the ability to phosphorylate the small polypeptide of eIF-2 and to inhibit protein synthesis. Untreated crude ribosomes also contain cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activities that phosphorylate the middle polypeptide (49,000 daltons) of eIF-2 and several polypeptide subunits of eIF-3 (160,000, 125,000, and 65,000 daltons); these kinase activities are not affected by double-stranded RNA and do not inhibit protein synthesis.

The molecular weight calculated on the basis of the sequence is 5928. The whole chain is homologous with the region between positions 75 and 121 from concanavalin A. The NH2-terminal sequence of the beta chain, determined by automated Edman degradation, is homologous to another portion of the concanavalin A molecule, between positions 123 and 165. Comparison of the 94 residues from the lentil lectin alpha and beta chains with concanavalin A reveals the existence of 43 identities. Thirty-four other homologies could have arisen, each by a single nucleotide substitution. This extensive homology suggests that the lentil lectin alpha and beta chains may be proteolytic fragments from a single polypeptide chain of the same length as concanavalin A.

Cells arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle showed increased incorporation of exogenous adenosine into their adenine nucleotide pools as compared with growing cells. This phenomenon is unexpected because salvage pathways from all other preformed nucleosides and bases as well as the de novo synthesis of adenine nucleotides is decreased after arrest of growth by serum deprivation. The incorporation of adenosine into adenine nucleotides may serve as an intracellular signal in the regulation of growth in mammalian cells.

A compound soluble in chloroform/methanol/water, 1:1:0.3 (vol/vol), was found that was indistinguishable from the previously described glucose-containing dolichyl diphosphate oligosaccharide formed by liver microsomes. Glycopeptides were prepared by treating the glycoproteins with pronase, the amino acids were removed with alkaline borohydride, and the products were examined by paper electrophoresis and chromatography. A saccharide equal to that which occurs in the glucose-containing dolichyl diphosphate oligosaccharide could not be detected but glucose was found in oligosaccharides that seemed to be smaller by about three to five monosaccharide residues. The same results were obtained by direct treatment of the glycoproteins with alkaline borohydride.

The same activity was detected in extracts of cells treated with mock preparations of interferon, but at <0.3% of the level found in interferon-treated cell extracts. The enzyme was activated by double-stranded RNA and could be isolated by binding to columns of poly(I)-poly(C)-agarose. In the column-bound state, the enzyme reacted with ATP to synthesize the inhibitor, which could then be continuously eluted from the column. The inhibitor was purified and its structure and function were compared with those of the low molecular weight inhibitor of protein synthesis made by an enzyme from interferon-treated mouse L cells. The avian and mammalian inhibitors comigrated on thin layers of polyethyleneimine-cellulose during chromatography in three different solvent systems, and they coeluted as a series of peaks from columns of DEAE-cellulose during sodium chloride gradient elution. Digestion with bacterial alkaline phosphatase or snake venom phosphodiesterase yielded products that similarly comigrated. Functionally, the two inhibitors were interchangeable: both inhibited protein synthesis in extracts of mammalian and avian cells, producing 50% inhibition at a concentration of about 0.3 nM (AMP equivalents). We conclude that the chick cell-derived oligonucleotide inhibitor has a structure that is closely related or identical to that of the inhibitor made in the mouse system, and that both preparations inhibit cell-free protein synthesis in a non-species-specific manner.

This protein was studied because it contains a single indole side chain which is deeply buried in an expandable oily region and because the phosphorescence of the homologous indole in bovine serum albumin could not be detected at ambient temperatures. The transient was identified on the following basis: (i) its triplet-triplet absorption spectrum was similar to those previously reported for indole and tryptophan; (ii) it was quenched by small quantities of oxygen; and (iii) it was photobleached by 370- to 700-nm light. In a nitrogen-saturated solution at room temperature, the indole triplet decays exponentially for more than a factor of 10 with a lifetime of 0.5 msec. These observations suggest that, because of its exponential decay and relatively long lifetime, the triplet will be more valuable than the indole singlet as an intrinsic reporter group for the study of the structure and dynamics of proteins in solution.

The newly synthesized RNA can be resolved by gel electrophoresis into a few predominant 4S RNA species and a series of slower migrating components. One of the 4S RNA species appears to be identical, by fingerprint analysis, to the tRNAMet1 isolated by hybridization of somatic cell RNA to this cloned tRNA gene fragment (tDNA). Thus, the tRNAMet1 produced after injection can be both fully processed and modified. Its rate of synthesis is estimated to be about 6 x 10(9) molecules/hr in each oocyte injected with 2 ng of tDNA. When the tDNA fragment is cleaved into two halves with restriction endonuclease Sst I, each injected half gives rise to a subset of the RNAs produced after injection of the intact fragment. This experiment thus suggests the presence of at least two transcriptional units on this cloned tDNA. This simple way of biologically testing defined restriction fragments may be of value for analyzing the functional organization of other cloned eukaryotic DNA units.

Purified alpha-, beta-, and gamma-crystallins have low D/L ratios. Fractionation of urea-solubilized material from the water-insoluble protein yields four molecular weight classes of proteins. Fractions representing crosslinked material or apparently degraded products have high D/L ratios. Racemization within lens proteins may contribute to formation of the water-insoluble fraction seen in aging lenses and cataracts.

Ligandin retained its capacity to bind bilirubin in the presence of components of liver supernatant, but albumin, which binds bilirubin in serum, lost the capacity to bind bilirubin in liver supernatant. This was attributed to a greater binding specificity exhibited by ligandin. In their respective physiological milieus, albumin and ligandin are structurally adapted to bind ligands: albumin in serum, and ligandin in the cytosol of the liver cell. These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that the concentration of ligandin within the liver could regulate the net flux of certain organic anions from plasma into the liver.

Using hybridization of globin cDNA to globin mRNA as a model system, we found that equivalent amounts of cDNA were required both for the saturation of the mRNA hybridization and for complete inhibition of globin synthesis. Also, the rate of inactivation of translation was identical to the rate of hybridization and followed the predicted kinetic form. This assay has been applied to the analysis of a set of abundant mRNAs in mouse liver. Hybridization of liver mRNA with total liver cDNA in slight excess to a low C(0)t value specifically inhibited translation of several major polypeptides. Melting of the hybrids prior to translation restored synthesis of these polypeptides. Moreover, we found that different liver mRNAs are inactivated with different kinetics; the results suggest that the mRNAs for the major urinary polypeptide and for albumin are the most abundant and second most abundant, respectively, in mouse liver. The general applications of this technique are discussed.

The fragments were separated on agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, hybridized to globin [(32)P]cDNA, and radioautographed. One to ten picograms of globin gene sequences were detectable. With EcoRI digestion, eight to nine cellular DNA fragments were found to contain globin genes. Three of these contained beta-like gene sequences assayed with beta globin cDNA probe. One beta-like fragment was absent in DNA from a homozygous subject for hemoglobin Lepore. Two of the three beta gene-containing fragments present in normal DNA were absent in DNA from a patient with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. The same two fragments containing beta-like genes were absent from deltabeta thalassemic DNA and one new fragment containing beta-like genes was found. Together with results obtained by hybridization of these DNAs in solution, the data are consistent with deletion of specific restriction human DNA fragments in subjects with these disorders and a greater deletion of beta-like gene sequences in subjects with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin than in those with deltabeta thalassemia.

The stereoselective synthesis makes use of the monolysocardiolipin 1-(3-sn-phosphatidyl)-3-[1-acyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero(3)phospho]-sn-glycerol, available from the stereospecific hydrolysis of cardiolipin by phospholipase A2 (phosphatide 2-acylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.4) of Trimeresurus flavoviridis. The results of treatment of the spin-labeled cardiolipin with the cardiolipin-specific phospholipase D (phosphatidylcholine phosphatidohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.4) (Hemophilus parainfluenzae) of known specificity and with phospholipase C (phosphatidylcholine cholinephosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.3) of Bacillus cereus are consistent with the assigned structure. The spin-labeled cardiolipin is further characterized and the unique features of this diastereomer are discussed in the context of the unusual stereochemistry of the natural phospholipid.

The reactions proceeded in equimolar concentrations of donors and acceptors. Several oligonucleotides of defined sequence were synthesized by this method in yields of 28-68%. The enzyme required the phosphate ester at the 3' position of the donor molecule, nucleoside 5',2'-diphosphates being unable to serve as donors. Thymidine 5',3'-diphosphate was active as a donor for the enzyme. The ligation product, (Ap)2ApCp, was also obtained from the reaction of (Ap)2A and 5'-adenylylated cytidine 5',3'-diphosphate (A5'pp5'Cp) with RNA ligase in the absence of ATP. These results show that the minimal substrate for RNA ligase is a nucleoside 5',3'-diphosphate.

N-Ethylmaleimide (10 mM) and iodoacetamide (1.5 mM) inhibited DNA polymerase-alpha activity completely, whereas only 35-40% inhibition was observed for DNA polymerase-beta under similar conditions. DNA polymerase-alpha activity was reduced 50-70% in N-18 cells that had been induced to differentiate by 4 micro M bromodeoxyuridine, and the low molecular weight DNA polymerase-beta activity remain unchanged. With activated calf thymus DNA as template, only DNA polymerase-alpha activity was stimulated in the presence of added ribonucleotides and purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase.

Treatment of genomic DNA with restriction endonucleases that do not cleave the ovalbumin mRNA sequence results in the generation of multiple DNA fragments capable of annealing with ovalbumin-specific probes in molecular hybridization reactions. These data strongly suggest that the linear order of DNA sequences coding for ovalbumin is interrupted by at least two intragenic DNA spacers absent from the corresponding RNA. At least one of these spacer sequences interrupts the coding sequence; therefore the chromosomal ovalbumin gene is not colinear with its translational product. We can discern no difference in the sequence organization about this gene in producer and nonproducer somatic cells, suggesting that the presence of intragenic spacers does not reflect that transcriptional activity of this gene. Furthermore, profiles obtained for gametes are identical to those observed for somatic cells, indicating that significant translocation during development is not responsible for the generation of this split sequence. Divergence of the intragenic spacer, however, is observed between individual chickens; thus multiple alleles may exist for this gene that are identifiable by differences in the organization of spacer with no apparent phenotypic evidence for their presence.

Correspondingly, the mature beta-globin mRNA appears to be synthesized via a 15S precursor, the length of which roughly equals the total length of the coding and intervening sequences of the beta-globin gene. Using the electron microscope to visualize hybrid structures formed between this gene and the purified 15S beta-globin mRNA precursor, we show that the intervening sequence is present within the larger precursor molecule. This finding suggests that the precursor mRNA is processed through the removal and rejoining of internal RNA sequences.

The thiomercuribenzoate derivatives bind selectively to wheat germ agglutinin in the same way as the corresponding sugars. Using the thiomercuribenzoate of di-N-acetyl-beta-chitobiose, it was found that: (i) the fluorescence of tryptophan residues was drastically quenched at both 298 and 77 K; (ii) the phosphorescence intensity was strongly enhanced at 77 K; (iii) the phosphorescence lifetime was markedly decreased. A similar effect was observed with the thiomercuribenzoate of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine. These changes were completely reversed upon addition of 1-O-methyl-di-N-acetyl-beta-chitobioside. The thiomercuribenzoate of beta-D-glucose had no effect at all, and the thiomercuribenzoate of tri-N-acetyl-beta-chitotriose had a limited effect. These results are interpreted as a specific heavy atom effect due to a close contact between one tryptophan residue of the protein and the heavy atom of the bound ligand. They are consistent with the view that: (i) binding sites of wheat germ agglutinin may be divided in three subsites, A, B, and C; (ii) a tryptophan residue is in the binding site at subsite C; and (iii) this residue and the ligand are in close contact. This new method, using the enhancement of spin-orbit coupling due to the selective perturbation induced in a tryptophan residue by a ligand containing a heavy atom, has proved to be suitable for locating the tryptophan residue in the binding site of wheat germ agglutinin and can probably be extended to other sugar-binding proteins.

Heritable genetic changes that affect a pair of matching populations can be evolutionary only when this matching quality is not disrupted. We distinguish two types of heritable change. Concordant heritable changes autonomously preserve the match and are thus automatically candidates for what we call type I evolutionary change. Nonconcordant heritable changes, on the other hand, are those that do not autonomously preserve the match. Those nonconcordant heritable changes that can use other normally present ontogenetic mechanisms to preserve the match are candidates for what we call type II evolutionary change. One example of such an ontogenetic mechanism consists of the production of excess neuroblasts and the subsequent weeding out (via cell death) of those that do not successfully match. Because normal ontogeny is an integral part of type II evolutionary change, ontogenetic manipulations can give evolutionary insights. Embryonic graft experiments, in particular, can elucidate the nature of ontogenetic mechanisms that participate in type II changes. Thus, some developmental experiments can be considered to be evolutionary experiments.

The resultant colony size distribution is an accurate indicator of the number of subsequent in vitro population doublings that can be attained by the parent culture. This relationship holds for both human fetal lung and adult skin fibroblast cultures. In addition, the colony size distributions obtained from fetal, young adult, and old adult human cell cultures at the same low level of in vitro passage are indicative of the in vivo age of the level of in vitro passage are indicative of the in vivo age of the cell culture donor. Cell cultures of fetal origin give rise to the highest percentage of colonies with significant proliferative abilities, whereas cultures from old adults give rise to the lowest percentage of large colonies. Therefore, colony size distributions appear to be good indicators of both in vitro and in vivo human cellular aging.

This process is called capping. Here, a novel explanation of such a process is presented in which the membrane is viewed as a supersaturated solution of receptors in the lipid bilayer and the adjacent two aqueous layers. Without a crosslinking agent, a patch of receptors that is less than a certain size cannot stay in equilibrium with the solution and thus should dissolve. Patches greater than a certain size are stable and can, in principle, grow by the precipitation of the remaining dissolved receptors from the supersaturated solution. The task of the crosslinking molecules is to form such stable patches. These considerations are based on a qualitative thermodynamic calculation that takes into account the existence of a boundary tension in a patch (in analogy to the surface tension of a droplet). Thermodynamically, these systems should cap spontaneously after the patches have reached a certain size. But, in practice, such a process can be very slow. A suspension of patches may stay practically stable. The ways in which a cell may abolish this metastable equilibrium and thus achieve capping are considered and possible effects of capping inhibitors are discussed.

Despite identification and characterization of numerous Hessian fly-responsive genes and associated biological pathways involved in wheat defense against this dipteran pest, their functional validation has been challenging. This is largely attributed to the large genome, polyploidy, repetitive DNA, and limited genetic resources in hexaploid wheat. The diploid progenitor Aegilops tauschii, D-genome donor of modern-day hexaploid wheat, offers an ideal surrogate eliminating the need to target all three homeologous chromosomes (A, B and D) individually, and thereby making the functional validation of candidate Hessian fly-responsive genes plausible. Furthermore, the well-annotated sequence of Ae. tauschii genome and availability of genetic resources amenable to manipulations makes the functional assays less tedious and time-consuming. However, prior to utilization of this diploid genome for downstream studies, it is imperative to characterize its physical and molecular responses to Hessian fly. In this study we screened five Ae. tauschii accessions for their response to the Hessian fly biotypes L and vH13. Two lines were identified that exhibited a homozygous resistance response to feeding by both Hessian fly biotypes. Studies using physical measurements and neutral red staining showed that the resistant Ae. tauschii accessions resembled hexaploid wheat in their phenotypic responses to Hessian fly, that included similarities in larval developmental stages, leaf and plant growth, and cell wall permeability. Furthermore, molecular responses, characterized by gene expression profiling using quantitative real-time PCR, in select resistant Ae. tauschii lines also revealed similarities with resistant hexaploid wheat. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of Ae. tauschii to Hessian fly infestation revealed resistant accessions that shared similarities to hexaploid wheat. Resembling the resistant hexaploid wheat, the Ae. tauschii accessions mount an early defense strategy involving defense proteins including lectins, secondary metabolites and reactive oxygen species (ROS) radicals. Our results reveal the suitability of the diploid progenitor for use as an ideal tool for functional genomics research in deciphering the wheat-Hessian fly molecular interactions.
31640551##2019####Copy number variation N | Horse N | SNP genotyping array N | Structural variation N##Copy Number Variation (CNV) is a common form of genetic variation underlying animal evolution and phenotypic diversity across a wide range of species. In the mammalian genome, high frequency of CNV differentiation between breeds may be candidates for population-specific selection. However, CNV differentiation, selection and its population genetics have been poorly explored in horses. We investigated the patterns, population variation and gene annotation of CNV using the Axiom® Equine Genotyping Array (670,796 SNPs) from a large cohort of individuals (N = 1755) belonging to eight European horse breeds, varying from draught horses to several warmblood populations. After quality control, 152,640 SNP CNVs (individual markers), 18,800 segment CNVs (consecutive SNP CNVs of same gain/loss state or both) and 939 CNV regions (CNVRs; overlapping segment CNVs by at least 1 bp) compared to the average signal of the reference (Belgian draught horse) were identified. Our analyses showed that Equus caballus chromosome 12 (ECA12) was the most enriched in segment CNV gains and losses (~ 3% average proportion of the genome covered), but the highest number of segment CNVs were detected on ECA1 and ECA20 (regardless of size). The Friesian horses showed private SNP CNV gains (> 20% of the samples) on ECA1 and Exmoor ponies displayed private SNP CNV losses on ECA25 (> 20% of the samples). The Warmblood cluster showed private SNP CNV gains located in ECA9 and Draught cluster showed private SNP CNV losses located in ECA7. The length of the CNVRs ranged from 1 kb to 21.3 Mb. A total of 10,612 genes were annotated within the CNVRs. The PANTHER annotation of these genes showed significantly under- and overrepresented gene ontology biological terms related to cellular processes and immunity (Bonferroni P-value < 0.05). We identified 80 CNVRs overlapping with known QTL for fertility, coat colour, conformation and temperament. We also report 67 novel CNVRs. This work revealed that CNV patterns, in the genome of some European horse breeds, occurred in specific genomic regions. The results provide support to the hypothesis that high frequency private CNVs residing in genes may potentially be responsible for the diverse phenotypes seen between horse breeds.

Thirty-three strains of lactic acid bacteria of Lactobacillus and Lactococcus genera from the Lomonosov Moscow State University Collection of Microorganisms (CM MSU) have been tested for important probiotic properties which assist these bacteria to settle effectively in intestines: cell adhesion, ability to form biofilms, agglutination with lectin (concanavalin A), and antimicrobial activity. The results of experiments clearly demonstrate that all these properties can be classified as strain characteristics and differ even within the same species. Besides the cultures of Lactobacillus with good agglutination ability with concanavalin A (Lact. caucasicus CM MSU 155, Lact. brevis CM MSU 521), we also discovered strains with high adhesion properties (Lact. acidophilus CM MSU 146-89% affinity for hexadecane; Lact. paracasei CM MSU 527-85%; Lact. plantarum CM MSU 508-78%; Lact. caucasicus CM MSU 155-70%; and Lact. delbrueckii CM MSU 571-57%), biofilm formation ability with a hydrophobic carrier (Lact. plantarum CM MSU 588-OD590 of crystal violet extracts = 1.336; Lact. brevis CM MSU 521-OD590 = 1.207; and Lact. brevis CM MSU 535-OD590 = 1.151), and with high antimicrobial activity specially to Staphylococcus aureus. Lact. brevis CM MSU 521 possesses the best property combination, which makes it potentially applicable as a very good lactic acid probiotic strain.

Lectins as a molecular probe were applied in lectin-IgG-ELISA to analyze the sialylation and galactosylation pattern of skim milk IgG of mothers who delivered at term and prematurely. Well-defined biotinylated lectins were used: Maackia amurensis II (MAA II), Sambucus nigra (SNA), Ricinus communis I (RCA I), and Griffonia simplicifolia II (GSL II) specific to α2,3-Neu5Ac, α2,6-Neu5Ac, Gal(β1,4)GlcNAc, and agalactosylated glycans, respectively. The sialylation pattern of milk IgG differs qualitatively and quantitatively from maternal plasma IgG and is related to lactation stage and perinatal risk factors. Expression of MAA-, SNA-, and GSL-reactive glycotopes on term milk IgG showed a positive correlation with milk maturation from days 1 to 55. Preterm birth was associated with an increase of MAA-reactive and a decrease of RCA-reactive IgG glycotopes. Moreover, higher SNA- and GSL-reactive and lower RCA-reactive glycoform levels of milk IgG were associated with infection of lactating mothers. Application of a specific and simple method, lectin-IgG-ELISA, reveals the sialylation pattern of milk IgG over milk maturation. However, further investigations are needed in this area.
31652516##2019####coefficient of friction N | friction N | polymers N | tests N | wear N##The tribological properties of PA66, PA46, and PTFE-mixed PA46 were investigated. The tests were achieved on a pin-on-disc tribometer. Before tests with different sets of parameters, a running-in-type test (with constant parameters) was performed for all the materials, under lubricated and dry conditions. The tests parameters were variable referring on load, velocity, and temperature. The results are referring on the value of the wear developed during the run-in period and on the variation of friction coefficient with the testing parameters. The results show that the PTFE-mixed PA46 polyamide has better tribological properties than the PA66 and the PA46 polyamide.
31687916##2019####Aphasia N | cohort study N | epidemiology N | prevalence N | stroke N##Background: Aphasia negatively impacts quality of life. This is the first Brazilian study that investigates the prevalence of aphasia and its related factors, the results of which may underpin hospital and health service planning for this vulnerable population.Objective: To establish the prevalence of aphasia in patients after first-ever ischemic stroke (FEIS) and associated factors.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study, based on a database held in Joinville, Brazil. All cases of FEIS admitted to one public hospital in Joinville in 2015 were selected. The diagnosis of aphasia was verified by neurologists through the language item of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).Results: Of the 350 patients with FEIS, 79 (22.6%) had aphasia. Patients with aphasia (PWA) were older, with a higher likelihood of dysarthria, more thrombolytic use, and greater stroke severity. PWA had higher mortality than patients without aphasia (24.1% versus 10.7%, p = .004) and longer hospitalization time (21.32 versus 17.46 days, p = .009). Higher NIHSS score was an independent predictor for the occurrence of aphasia on admission (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.31, p < .001). Older age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09, p < .001) and stroke severity by NIHSS (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.25, p = <0.001) were independent predictors of death.Conclusions: PWA may need more health care during hospitalization, because of the severity of the stroke, and their frailty. Further studies are needed to assess the direct impact of aphasia on inpatients.
31687917##2019####Sudden death N | WCD N | arrhythmia N | cardiology N | wearable cardioverter defibrillator N##The introduction of wearable cardioverter defibrillators (WCD) provides a novel means of protection in select patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death. The WCD can safely record and terminate life-threatening arrhythmias. In this review, we explore the data behind indications for WCD use and discuss its limitations. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials for relevant studies. The VEST trial, the first randomised controlled trial on WCD use, did not show statistical significance in utility of the WCD in post-myocardial infarction patients with low ejection fraction. While the use of WCD in this select patient population showed no benefit, the findings of the trial merit closer inspection. Various other indications of WCD use still exist and others require exploration. Select subsets of patients who stand to benefit for other indications include severely decreased left ventricular function post-revascularization with high arrhythmic burden, severe non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, patients awaiting heart transplant and patients who have had their implantable cardioverter device temporarily removed. The role of the WCD is also being explored in children, peripartum cardiomyopathy, haemodialysis patients, and in syncope secondary to high-risk arrhythmias.
31687918##2019######Background Although chemical shift-encoded (CSE) MRI proton density fat fraction (PDFF) is the current noninvasive reference standard for liver fat quantification, the liver is more frequently imaged with CT. Purpose To validate quantitative CT measurements of liver fat against the MRI PDFF reference standard. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 400 healthy participants were recruited between August 2015 and July 2016. Each participant underwent same-day abdominal unenhanced quantitative CT with a calibration phantom and CSE 3.0-T MRI. CSE MRI liver fat measurements were used to calibrate an equation to adjust CT fat measurements and put them on the PDFF measurement scale. CT and PDFF liver fat measurements were plotted as histograms, medians, and interquartile ranges compared; scatterplots and Bland-Altman plots obtained; and Pearson correlation coefficients calculated. Receiver operating characteristic curves including areas under the curve were evaluated for mild (PDFF, 5%) and moderate (PDFF, 14%) steatosis thresholds for both raw and adjusted CT measurements. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated. Results Four hundred volunteers (mean age, 52.6 years ± 15.2; 227 women) were evaluated. MRI PDFF measurements of liver fat ranged between 0% and 28%, with 41.5% (166 of 400) of participants with PDFF greater than 5%. Both raw and adjusted quantitative CT values correlated well with MRI PDFF (r2 = 0.79; P < .001). Bland-Altman analysis of adjusted CT values showed no slope or bias. Both raw and adjusted CT had areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 and 0.99, respectively, to identify participants with mild (PDFF, >5%) and moderate (PDFF, >14%) steatosis, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for unadjusted CT was 75.9% (126 of 166), 85.0% (199 of 234), 78.3% (126 of 161), and 83.3% (199 of 239), respectively, for PDFF greater than 5%; and 84.8% (28 of 33), 98.4% (361 of 367), 82.4% (28 of 34), and 98.6% (361 of 366), respectively, for PDFF greater than 14%. Results for adjusted CT were mostly identical. Conclusion Quantitative CT liver fat exhibited good correlation and accuracy with proton density fat fraction measured with chemical shift-encoded MRI. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
31689156##2019######Background Diagnostic uncertainty in CT of possible intracranial hemorrhage requires short-interval follow-up imaging, resulting in reduced efficiency of care and higher costs. Purpose To quantify the diagnostic performance of dual-energy CT versus simulated single-energy CT in the differentiation of small foci of intracranial hemorrhage from calcium. Materials and Methods Images from consecutive unenhanced dual-energy CT of the head in patients from a single emergency department obtained from December 2014 to April 2016 were reviewed retrospectively for hyperattenuating intracranial foci. Ground truth was established from reference standard comparison CT or MRI. Foci were divided into development and test sets. Development set foci regions of interest were used to derive candidate CT attenuation thresholds for virtual noncalcium (VNCa) and calcium images. Test set foci were used for threshold validation, and diagnostic performance and confidence were evaluated for two readers blinded to final diagnosis. Statistical comparisons were made with exact binomial tests or repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results The study included 137 patients (65 years ± 17; 70 men) with 146 foci. Foci were divided into a development set (n = 105) and a test set (n = 41). Quantitative analysis of the development set produced candidate thresholds of 44 HU for VNCa images and 7 HU for calcium-only images, yielding diagnostic accuracies for the test set of 88% (36 of 41 foci; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 78%, 98%) and 95% (39 of 41 foci; 95% CI: 88%, 100%), respectively. Dual-energy CT improved reader accuracy from 90% (reader 1, 37 of 41 foci; 95% CI: 81%, 99%) and 93% (reader 2, 38 of 41 foci; 95% CI: 85%, 100%) to 100% (both readers, 41 of 41 foci; 95% CI: 100%, 100%). Diagnostic confidence (classifications rated as "certain") increased from 71% (29 of 41 foci; 95% CI: 57%, 85%) to 90% (37 of 41 foci; 95% CI: 81%, 99%) for reader 1 (P = .019) and from 46% (19 of 41 foci; 95% CI: 31%, 62%) to 85% (35 of 41 foci; 95% CI: 75%, 96%) for reader 2 (P = .0001). Conclusion Dual-energy CT showed high diagnostic performance in the differentiation of small foci of intracranial hemorrhage from calcium and improved diagnostic accuracy and confidence in the initial evaluation of suspected hemorrhage. © RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by Kotsenas in this issue.
31687920##2019######Background Impaired brain development in fetuses with congenital heart disease (CHD) may result from inadequate cerebral oxygen supply in utero. Purpose To test whether fetal cerebral oxygenation can be increased by maternal oxygen administration, effects of maternal hyperoxia on blood oxygenation of the placenta and fetal brain were examined by using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, BOLD MRI was performed in 86 fetuses (56 healthy fetuses and 30 fetuses diagnosed with CHD) between 22 and 39 weeks gestational age (GA) from May 2015 to December 2017, with the following study design: phase I, 2-minute resting state at baseline (room air); phase II, 6-minute maternal hyperoxia with 100% oxygen; and phase III, 5.6-minute return to resting state. After motion correction, the signals were averaged over the placenta and fetal brain and converted to the change in R2* (ΔR2*). Fetuses with CHD were categorized into those with a single ventricle (SV) or two ventricles (TVs) and those with aortic obstruction (AO) or non-AO. Data were analyzed by using generalized linear mixed models controlling for GA and sex. Results Placental ΔR2* increased during maternal hyperoxia in healthy fetuses and fetuses with CHD, but it was higher in SV CHD (mean ΔR2*, 1.3 sec-1 ± 0.1 [standard error; P < .01], 1.9 sec-1 ± 0.2 [P < .01], and 1.0 sec-1 ± 0.3 [P < .01], respectively, for control fetuses, fetuses with SV CHD, and fetuses with TV CHD). Placental ΔR2* during maternal hyperoxia changed with GA in healthy control fetuses and fetuses with SV or AO CHD (ΔR2* per week, 0.1 sec-1 ± 0 [P < .01], 0.2 sec-1 ± 0 [P = .01], and 0.2 sec-1 ± 0 [P = .01], respectively), but not in fetuses with CHD and TV or non-AO. Fetal brain ΔR2* was constant across all phases in healthy control fetuses and fetuses with TV CHD but increased during maternal hyperoxia in fetuses with SV or AO CHD (mean ΔR2*, 0.7 sec-1 ± 0.2 [P = .01] and 0.5 sec-1 ± 0.2 [P = .02], respectively). Conclusion Six minutes of maternal hyperoxia increased placental oxygenation in healthy fetuses and fetuses with congenital heart disease, and it selectively increased cerebral blood oxygenation in fetuses with single ventricle or aortic obstruction. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
31687921##2019######The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) US risk stratification and management system is designed to provide consistent interpretations, to decrease or eliminate ambiguity in US reports resulting in a higher probability of accuracy in assigning risk of malignancy to ovarian and other adnexal masses, and to provide a management recommendation for each risk category. It was developed by an international multidisciplinary committee sponsored by the American College of Radiology and applies the standardized reporting tool for US based on the 2018 published lexicon of the O-RADS US working group. For risk stratification, the O-RADS US system recommends six categories (O-RADS 0-5), incorporating the range of normal to high risk of malignancy. This unique system represents a collaboration between the pattern-based approach commonly used in North America and the widely used, European-based, algorithmic-style International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa model system, a risk prediction model that has undergone successful prospective and external validation. The pattern approach relies on a subgroup of the most predictive descriptors in the lexicon based on a retrospective review of evidence prospectively obtained in the IOTA phase 1-3 prospective studies and other supporting studies that assist in differentiating management schemes in a variety of almost certainly benign lesions. With O-RADS US working group consensus, guidelines for management in the different risk categories are proposed. Both systems have been stratified to reach the same risk categories and management strategies regardless of which is initially used. At this time, O-RADS US is the only lexicon and classification system that encompasses all risk categories with their associated management schemes.
31689157##2019######Background Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer have a dismal prognosis, with a median overall survival (OS) of 12-14 months with systemic therapies. Irreversible electroporation (IRE), a nonthermal ablative technique, may prolong survival of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Purpose To investigate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous IRE for locally advanced pancreatic cancer and locally recurring pancreatic cancer in a prospective phase II trial. Materials and Methods Between December 2012 and September 2017, participants with locally advanced pancreatic cancer or postresection local recurrence were prospectively treated with percutaneous CT-guided IRE (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01939665). The primary end point was median OS from diagnosis. The target median OS was 11.6 months for participants receiving no induction chemotherapy or gemcitabine-based induction chemotherapy and 14.9 months for those receiving induction 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX). Results Fifty participants (25 men and 25 women; median age, 61 years [interquartile range, 56-69 years]; 40 with locally advanced pancreatic cancer and 10 with local recurrence) were included. Median OS measured by using the Kaplan-Meier method was 17 months from diagnosis of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15 months, 19 months) and 10 months from IRE (95% CI: 8 months, 11 months). In the locally advanced pancreatic cancer group, 18 participants received no therapy or gemcitabine-based induction chemotherapy and 22 received FOLFIRINOX. The median OS from diagnosis was 17 months for both groups (95% CI: 7 months, 28 months and 15 months, 18 months, respectively; P = .26). For participants with postresection local recurrence, the median OS was 16 months from diagnosis of recurrence (95% CI: 11 months, 22 months) and 9 months from IRE (95% CI: 2 months, 16 months). After IRE, local recurrence developed in 23 of the 50 participants (46%). Tumor volume of 37 cm3 or greater (hazard ratio [HR], 2.9; P = .02), pre-IRE carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level of 2000 U/mL or greater (HR, 12.1; P = .001), and decrease in CA 19-9 level of 50% or less 3 months after IRE (HR, 3.1; P = .01) were predictors of worse survival. Fourteen minor and 21 major complications occurred in 29 of the 50 participants (58%). Two participants died less than 90 days after IRE; one of these deaths was likely related to IRE. Conclusion The target median overall survival with CT-guided percutaneous irreversible electroporation was exceeded in participants with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (17 months) and those with local recurrence (16 months). © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

31687929##2019####Cryptochrome 1 N | Period 2 N | S. cerevisiae N | biochemistry N | chemical biology N | mouse N | neuroscience N | nuclear import N | phosphorylation N | proteasome N##Circadian oscillations emerge from transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops. An important step in generating rhythmicity is the translocation of clock components into the nucleus, which is regulated in many cases by kinases. In mammals, the kinase promoting the nuclear import of the key clock component Period 2 (PER2) is unknown. Here, we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) regulates the mammalian circadian clock involving phosphorylation of PER2. Knock-down of Cdk5 in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the main coordinator site of the mammalian circadian system, shortened the free-running period in mice. CDK5 phosphorylated PER2 at serine residue 394 (S394) in a diurnal fashion. This phosphorylation facilitated interaction with Cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) and nuclear entry of the PER2-CRY1 complex. Taken together, we found that CDK5 drives nuclear entry of PER2, which is critical for establishing an adequate circadian period of the molecular circadian cycle. Of note is that CDK5 may not exclusively phosphorylate PER2, but in addition may regulate other proteins that are involved in the clock mechanism. Taken together, it appears that CDK5 is critically involved in the regulation of the circadian clock and may represent a link to various diseases affected by a derailed circadian clock.
31687930##2019####eye movement N | motor cortex N | mouse N | neuroscience N | plasticity N##Cortical plasticity is fundamental to motor recovery following cortical perturbation. However, it is still unclear how this plasticity is induced at a functional circuit level. Here, we investigated motor recovery and underlying neural plasticity upon optogenetic suppression of a cortical area for eye movement. Using a visually-guided eye movement task in mice, we suppressed a portion of the secondary motor cortex (MOs) that encodes contraversive eye movement. Optogenetic unilateral suppression severely impaired contraversive movement on the first day. However, on subsequent days the suppression became inefficient and capability for the movement was restored. Longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging revealed that the regained capability was accompanied by an increased number of neurons encoding for ipsiversive movement in the unsuppressed contralateral MOs. Additional suppression of the contralateral MOs impaired the recovered movement again, indicating a compensatory mechanism. Our findings demonstrate that repeated optogenetic suppression leads to functional recovery mediated by the contralateral hemisphere.
31687931##2019####D. melanogaster N | cell biology N | chromosomes N | gene expression N | heterochromatin N | histone-protamine exchange N | non-coding RNA N | repetitive RNA N | satellite RNA N | spermatogenesis N##Tandemly-repeated DNAs, or satellites, are enriched in heterochromatic regions of eukaryotic genomes and contribute to nuclear structure and function. Some satellites are transcribed, but we lack direct evidence that specific satellite RNAs are required for normal organismal functions. Here, we show satellite RNAs derived from AAGAG tandem repeats are transcribed in many cells throughout Drosophila melanogaster development, enriched in neurons and testes, often localized within heterochromatic regions, and important for viability. Strikingly, we find AAGAG transcripts are necessary for male fertility, and that AAGAG RNA depletion results in defective histone-protamine exchange, sperm maturation and chromatin organization. Since these events happen late in spermatogenesis when the transcripts are not detected, we speculate that AAGAG RNA in primary spermatocytes 'primes' post-meiosis steps for sperm maturation. In addition to demonstrating essential functions for AAGAG RNAs, comparisons between closely related Drosophila species suggest that satellites and their transcription evolve quickly to generate new functions.
31721356##2019####KLF2 N | angiogenesis N | endothelial cell N | mesenchymal stem cell N | osteogenesis N | stemness N##Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are undifferentiated stem cells with the property of stemness and the potential to differentiate into multiple lineages, including osteoblasts, have attracted a great deal of attention in bone tissue engineering. Consistent with the heterogeneity of MSCs, various surface markers have been used. However, it is still unclear which markers of MSCs are best for cell amplification in vitro and later bone regeneration in vivo. Krüppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2) is an important indicator of the stemness of human MSCs (hMSCs) and as early vascularization is also critical for bone regeneration, we used KLF2 as a novel in vitro marker for MSCs and investigated the angiogenesis and osteogenesis between KLF2+ MSCs and endothelial cells (ECs). We found a synergistic interaction between hMSCs and human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) in that KLF2+ stemness-maintained hMSCs initially promoted the angiogenesis of HUVECs, which in turn more efficiently stimulated the osteogenesis of hMSCs. In fact, KLF2+ hMSCs secreted angiogenic factors initially, with some of the cells then differentiating into pericytes through the PDGF-BB/PDGFR-β signaling pathway, which improved blood vessel formation. The matured HUVECs in turn synergistically enhanced the osteogenesis of KLF2+ hMSCs through upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor. A three-dimensional coculture model using cell-laden gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel further confirmed these results. This study provides insight into the stemness-directed synergistic interaction between hMSCs and HUVECs, and our results will have a profound impact on further strategies involving the application of KLF2+ hMSC/HUVEC-laden GelMA hydrogel in vascular network bioengineering and bone regeneration.
31721357##2019####brush polymers N | glycopolymers N | lectins N | multivalency N | sequence-defined N##The synthesis of brush glycopolymers mimicking the architecture of proteoglycans is achieved by grafting sequence-defined glycooligomers derived from solid-phase polymer synthesis onto a poly(active ester) scaffold. This approach gives access to a first library of brush glycopolymers with controlled variations in the degree of branching and number of carbohydrate ligands per branch. When studying lectin binding of linear and brush glycopolymers to lectins Concanavalin A (ConA), dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), and mannose-binding lectin (MBL), different preferences are observed with MBL showing higher binding to linear glycopolymer and ConA and DC-SIGN favoring brush glycopolymers. This finding suggests that the architecture of polymeric glycan mimetics affects binding to lectins not only in terms of creating higher avidity but potentially also selectivity ligands.
31721358##2019####CFTR N | biomarker N | breast cancer N | methylation N##Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. New biomarkers with definite diagnostic and prognostic efficacy are urgently needed. Here, we showed that the promoter of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) was hypermethylated in breast cancer. The messenger RNA level of CFTR was downregulated in breast cancer. Notably, all 19 breast cancer patients with hypermethylated CFTR were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma. Moreover, CFTR was upregulated in decitabine (10 μM) treated breast cancer cells. Overexpression of CFTR inhibited cell growth whereas knockdown of CFTR promoted cell invasion. In the tissue array analysis, the CFTR protein level decreased significantly in breast cancer and low CFTR protein level correlated with poor survival with a P-value of 0.034. Thus, promoter hypermethylation of the CFTR gene might be a novel diagnostic marker of breast cancer.
31723456##2019####nitric oxide N | skin neoplasms N | sun N | vitamin D N##Excessive solar exposure presents well-recognized risks and side effects, solar radiation being the most important environmental factor concerning skin cancer. In the last few years, several connections between solar exposure and prevention and/or treatment of several diseases have been discussed, with studies suggesting that regular solar exposure may be beneficial for conditions such as colorectal, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; arterial hypertension; obesity; type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome; nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis; multiple sclerosis; Alzheimer disease; and several psychiatric disturbances. In most cases, UV radiation's beneficial effects are mediated through vitamin D; however, studies show that in other instances other mediators are responsible for these associations, specifically nitric oxide. Moderation is therefore essential, as a strict strategy of total sun avoidance may be inadequate.
31723457##2019####clinico-dermoscopic correlation N | dermatopathology-dermoscopic correlation N | dermoscopy N | onychoscopy N | teledermoscopy N | trichoscopy N##The technique of dermoscopy has come a long way since its inception for characterization of suspicious nevi for early detection of dysplastic changes in predisposed individuals. Not only has its scope expanded to aid in quick diagnosis of a majority of nonmelanocytic disorders of the skin, hair, and nails, but it is being rightfully exploited for a plethora of nondiagnostic uses. Its use in the diagnosis of various pigmentary, papulosquamous, and infectious disorders and disorders of the scalp and hair, nails, and mucosa bears testimony to the ongoing expansion of its protean indications across skin types. Dermoscopy has transformed the conventional approach to dermatological diagnosis from clinicopathological correlation to clinico-dermoscopic-pathological correlation. It aids in convincing an otherwise reluctant patient to agree to biopsy and guides the selection of optimum site for the same. Dermoscopic clues suggestive of stability or activity of the lesion and/or disease in various dermatoses are being accrued. Early assessment of therapeutic response to treatment is helpful for physicians, patients, and researchers conducting clinical studies. Aesthetic uses of dermoscopy are opulent and being explored. Dermoscopy has also provided the much-needed balancing act of interaction between practitioners and the new generation of patients. Last but not the least, dermoscopy has resulted in patients' better understanding of their disorders and improved compliance with treatment protocols.
31723458##2019####basal cell carcinoma N | immunocompromised district N | pigment N | skin cancer N | tattoo N##The placement of a tattoo is a common event. Basal cell carcinoma arising from a tattoo is rare despite this neoplasm being the most common form of skin cancer. We describe a 41-year-old man who developed a basal cell carcinoma in his tattoo and review the literature of basal cell carcinomas originating in a tattoo. A literature search using PubMed was performed. The following terms were searched: "basal," "carcinoma," "cell," and "tattoo." The characteristics of individuals with a basal cell carcinoma originating in a tattoo were analyzed and summarized. A total of 13 patients (6 women and 7 men) with a basal cell carcinoma arising in a tattoo have been reported. The majority of the tumors were located on the head (6 cases, 46.2%) followed by either an upper extremity (4 cases, 30.7%) or the trunk (3 cases, 23.1%). Most of the carcinomas were asymptomatic; however, 2 patients reported pruritus associated with their tumor. Nodular basal cell carcinoma was the most common subtype diagnosed (5 tumors), followed by superficial basal cell carcinoma (2 tumors). One patient had either a pagetoid or a mixed (nodular and sclerosing) histology. The pathological variant was not described for 4 patients. Basal cell carcinoma arising in a tattoo is a rare occurrence. Although this occurrence may be coincidental, emerging evidence of carcinogenesis associated with tattoo pigment may suggest a causal link. Elucidating this important relationship warrants further investigation.

31723460##2019####alopecia areata incognita N | diffuse alopecia areata N | histopathology N | therapy N | yellow dots N##Alopecia areata is a nonscarring hair loss that usually causes round patches of baldness, but alopecia areata incognita (AAI) and diffuse alopecia areata (DAA) can cause a diffuse and acute pattern of hair loss. To analyze the clinical, trichoscopic, histological, and therapeutic features of AAI and DAA. The study was designed to include data of patients with histological diagnosis of AAI and DAA enrolled in our Hair Disease Outpatient Consultations. DAA had a greater involvement of the parietal and anterior-temporal regions, while AAI manifested itself mainly in the occipital-parietal regions. The most frequent pattern was empty yellow dots, yellow dots with vellus hairs, and small hair in regrowth, but the presence of pigtail hair was found almost exclusively in those with AAI. In cases of DDA, the finding of dystrophic hair and black dots was more frequent. The most frequent trichoscopic sign in both diseases was the presence of empty yellow dots, which, however, were described in a higher percentage in cases of DAA. The diseases have a benign course and are responsive to topical steroid therapy. Trichoscopy is very important for the differential diagnosis between the 2 diseases and to select the best site for biopsy. In the presence of diffuse hair thinning, these entities must be considered.
31723461##2019####cancer epidemiology N | skin cancer N | squamous cell carcinoma N | supplements N | vitamin D N##The relationship between vitamin D and skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is not well defined. To investigate the relationship between vitamin D levels and the incidence of skin SCC for the first time in Iran. In this case-control study, 126 subjects were enrolled (63 in each group) out of referents to Razi Skin Hospital in Tehran in 2014. The risk factors for cancer gathered by self-reported questionnaires and blood samples were obtained to measure the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Multivariate logistic regression was used to neutralize the effect of confounding factors. Cases of SCC were more likely to be in men, older than 49 years and working in an outdoor environment, and with longtime exposure to sunlight and a personal history of skin cancers. Family history of skin cancer and of cigarette smoking were not significantly related to SCC. In the SCC and control groups, 69.8% and 31.7%, respectively, had sufficient levels of vitamin D (P < 0.001). Mean level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 40.99 ng/mL in the SCC group and 26.34 ng/mL in the control group (P < 0.05). In the unadjusted model, the level of vitamin D as a continuous variable was positively related to SCC risk. In the adjusted model, vitamin D did not independently predict the likelihood of SCC. Vitamin D level and SCC risk are directly related, although not in an independent fashion. Indeed, this relation is severely confounded by exposure to sunlight, which was evidenced by an increased vitamin D level in the people working outside and the higher prevalence of SCC in the same population.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is intricately involved in all stages from initial break down of existing ECM to synthesis of new ECM to form the scar. This review will summarize our current knowledge on the processes involved in ECM remodeling after MI and identify the gaps that still need to be filled.

31724699##2019####bacteria N | glycosylation N | immunomodulation N | innate immunity N | lectins N##Bacterial surfaces are rich in glycoconjugates that are mainly present in their outer layers and are of great importance for their interaction with the host innate immune system. The innate immune system is the first barrier against infection and recognizes pathogens via conserved pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Lectins expressed by innate immune cells represent an important class of PRRs characterized by their ability to recognize carbohydrates. Among lectins in innate immunity, there are three major classes including the galectins, siglecs, and C-type lectin receptors. These lectins may contribute to initial recognition of bacterial glycans, thus providing an early defence mechanism against bacterial infections, but they may also be exploited by bacteria to escape immune responses. In this review, we will first exemplify bacterial glycosylation systems; we will then describe modes of recognition of bacterial glycans by lectins in innate immunity and, finally, we will briefly highlight how bacteria have found ways to exploit these interactions to evade immune recognition.
31724700##2019######To assess intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of the evaluation of the Frӓnkel Manoeuvre (FM) on three-dimensional (3D) scans and to compare it to the assessment on two-dimensional (2D) pictures. This study included 44 individuals with a skeletal Class II malocclusion [9-16-years old mean age ± standard deviation: 13.5 ± 2.01 years]. All patients had a full Class II molar relationship, overjet ≥6 mm and point A, Nasion, point B angle (ANB) ≥5 degrees. During the FM, each patient was invited to bite in centric occlusion and then to posture the mandible forward to reach a Class I molar relationship. The FM was recorded both by a normal camera and a 3D scanner (3dMD system). Six examiners divided into two groups according to their orthodontic clinical experience (<5 and >10 years), and one gold standard in the evaluation of FM, commented twice (every 15 days) on both 2D photographs (T0 and T2) and 3D scans (T1 and T3). The intra-observer agreement and the inter-observer agreement compared to the gold standard were evaluated by computing the Cohen's K. The agreement between observations for each examiner ranged from 0.36 to 1 on 2D pictures (T0 versus T2), and from 0.22 to 0.69 on 3D scans (T1 versus T3). The overall agreement was 0.63 (95 per cent CI = 0.35-0.91) in 2D analysis and 0.5 (95 per cent CI = 0.35-0.64) in 3D analysis. The FM was less reproducible when performed on 3D records than on 2D pictures.
31724701##2019######Exposome-Explorer (http://exposome-explorer.iarc.fr) is a database of dietary and pollutant biomarkers measured in population studies. In its first release, Exposome-Explorer contained comprehensive information on 692 biomarkers of dietary and pollution exposures extracted from the analysis of 480 peer-reviewed publications. Today, Exposome-Explorer has been further expanded and contains a total of 908 biomarkers. Two additional types of information have been collected. First, 185 candidate dietary biomarkers having 403 associations with food intake (as measured by metabolomic studies) have been identified and added. Second, 1356 associations between dietary biomarkers and cancer risk in epidemiological studies, which were collected from 313 publications, have also been added to the database. Classifications for both foods and compounds have been revised, and new classifications for biospecimens, analytical methods and cancers have been implemented. Finally, the web interface has been redesigned to significantly improve the user experience.
31724702##2019####active tuberculosis N | differential interaction N | drug repurposing N | gene expression correlation N | latent tuberculosis N##Although intensive efforts have been devoted to investigating latent tuberculosis (LTB) and active tuberculosis (PTB) infections, the similarities and differences in the host responses to these two closely associated stages remain elusive, probably due to the difficulty in identifying informative genes related to LTB using traditional methods. Herein, we developed a framework known as the consistently differential expression network to identify tuberculosis (TB)-related gene pairs by combining microarray profiles and protein-protein interactions. We thus obtained 774 and 693 pairs corresponding to the PTB and LTB stages, respectively. The PTB-specific genes showed higher expression values and fold-changes than the LTB-specific genes. Furthermore, the PTB-related pairs generally had higher expression correlations and would be more activated compared to their LTB-related counterparts. The module analysis implied that the detected gene pairs tended to cluster in the topological and functional modules. Functional analysis indicated that the LTB- and PTB-specific genes were enriched in different pathways and had remarkably different locations in the NF-κB signaling pathway. Finally, we showed that the identified genes and gene pairs had the potential to distinguish TB patients in different disease stages and could be considered as drug targets for the specific treatment of patients with LTB or PTB.
31754329##2019####Beta cells N | EGFR signaling N | ETS2 N | Insulin. N | MicroRNA-124a N##Diabetes mellitus is characterized by pancreatic β cell dysfunction. Previous studies have indicated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and microRNA-124a (miR-124a) play opposite roles in insulin biosynthesis and secretion by beta cells. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that EGF could inhibit miR-124a expression in beta cell lines through downstream signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) cascades. Further, the transcription factor ETS2, a member of the ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family, was identified to be responsible for the EGF-mediated suppression of miR-124a expression, which was dependent on ETS2 phosphorylation at threonine 72. Activation of ETS2 decreased miR-124a promoter transcriptional activity through the putative conserved binding sites AGGAANA/TN in three miR-124a promoters located in different chromosomes. Of note, ETS2 played a positive role in regulating beta cell function-related genes, including miR-124a targets, Forkhead box a2 (FOXA2) and Neurogenic differentiation 1 (NEUROD1), which may have partly been through the inhibition of miR-124 expression. Knockdown and overexpression of ETS2 led to the prevention and promotion of insulin biosynthesis respectively, while barely affecting the secretion ability. These results suggest that EGF may induce the activation of ETS2 to inhibit miR-124a expression to maintain proper beta cell functions and that ETS2, as a novel regulator of insulin production, is a potential therapeutic target for diabetes mellitus treatment.
31754330##2019####CKLFSF N | CMTM N | MARVEL N | non-small cell lung cancer N | tumor suppressor gene N##CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing member (CMTM) is a new gene family first cloned and reported in 2001. The CMTM family consists of nine members including CKLF and CMTM1-CMTM8, which are located on different chromosomes. Besides exhibiting extensive chemotactic activity, the CMTM family plays an important role in the hematopoiesis system, the immune system, the cardiovascular system and the male reproductive system. Recent in-depth research has also revealed that CMTM is closely associated with the genesis, development and metastasis of tumors, displaying opposing activities in diverse human tumors. In this review, we discuss the structural and functional characteristics of the CMTM family and summarize latest research findings of the relationship between several CMTM members and non-small cell lung cancer.
31754332##2019####PHKB N | epithelial-mesenchymal transition N | glycogen breakdown N | prognostic indicator N | signaling pathway N##Glycogen phosphorylase kinase β-subunit (PHKB) is a regulatory subunit of phosphorylase kinase (PHK), involving in the activation of glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and the regulation of glycogen breakdown. Emerging evidence suggests that PHKB plays a role in tumor progression. However, the function of PHKB in HCC progression remains elusive. Here, our study revealed that the expression of PHKB significantly decreased in HCC tissues, and the low expression of PHKB could serve as an independent indicator for predicting poor prognosis in HCC. Functional experiments showed that PHKB knockdown significantly promoted cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, whereas PHKB overexpression resulted in opposing effects. Additionally, in vitro assays revealed that the over (or high) expression of PHKB greatly hindered HCC cell invasion and increased apoptosis rates. Also, we found that the over (or high) expression of PHKB effectively suppressed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which was further confirmed by our clinical data. Intriguingly, the biological function of PHKB in HCC was independent of glycogen metabolism. Mechanically, PHKB could inhibit AKT and STAT3 signaling pathway activation in HCC. Collectively, our data demonstrate that PHKB acts as a novel prognostic indicator for HCC, which exerts its suppression function via inactivating AKT and STAT3. Our data might provide novel insights into progression and facilitate the development of a new therapeutic strategy for HCC.
31778854##2019####Congenital diarrheal disorder N | DGAT1 N | Malnutrition N##DGAT1, a gene encoding a protein involved in lipid metabolism, has been recently implicated in causing a rare nutritional and digestive disease presenting as Congenital Diarrheal Disorder (CDD). Genetic causes of malnutrition can be classified as metabolic disorders, caused by loss of a specific enzyme's function. However, disease driven by genetic variants in lipid metabolism genes is not well understood, and additional information is needed to better understand these effects. We gathered a multi-institutional cohort of undiagnosed patients with a constellation of phenotypes presenting as malnutrition and metal ion dysregulation. Clinical Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed on four patients and their unaffected parents. We prioritized genetic variants based on multiple criteria including population allele frequency and presumed inheritance pattern, and identified a candidate gene. Computational modeling was used to investigate if the altered amino acids are likely to result in a dysfunctional enzyme. We identified a multi-institutional cohort of patients presenting with malnutrition-like symptoms and likely pathogenic genomic variants within DGAT1. Multiple approaches were used to profile the effect these variants have on protein structure and function. Laboratory and nutritional intervention studies showed rapid and robust patient responses. This report adds on to the database for existing mutations known within DGAT1, a gene recently implicated with CDD, and also expands its clinical spectrum. Identification of these DGAT1 mutations by WES has allowed for changes in the patients' nutritional rehabilitation, reversed growth failure and enabled them to be weaned off of total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
31778855##2019####Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome N | Dominant negative effect N | Folliculin N | Haploinsufficiency N | Tumor suppressor gene N##Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHDS) is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome caused by a germline mutation of the folliculin (FLCN) gene. Previous studies have suggested that truncated mutant folliculin proteins generated by disease causing FLCN mutations may retain partial functionality and contribute to disease phenotype. A 38-year-old Russian man presented with a left renal tumor. He underwent a left radical nephrectomy and histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. He had papulae on his face suggestive of fibrofolliculomas, and pulmonary cysts on his computed tomography of the chest. He had a family history of skin manifestations. Genetic analysis identified a genomic deletion including the putative promoter region of FLCN exon 1 in the germline, and the second hit on the remaining wild-type FLCN in the renal carcinoma cells, which is expected to cause the complete lack of folliculin protein. Immunohistochemistry with the use of anti-folliculin antibody showed no antibody-binding on chromophobe renal carcinoma cells. These findings suggest that the decreased FLCN expression itself without producing mutated folliculin proteins can be at risk for developing clinical manifestations of BHDS: fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts, and tumorigenesis in the kidneys. This sheds light on the pathogenesis of BHDS and the role of FLCN as a tumor suppressor gene.
31778856##2019####AGPAT2 gene N | CAVIN1 gene N | Congenital generalized lipodystrophy N | Duodenal perforation N | Pyloric stenosis N##Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare disorder characterized by lipoatrophy affecting the face, limbs and trunk, acromegaloid features, hepatomegaly, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance. The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term follow-up findings including gastrointestinal and cardiac manifestations of the patients with CGL1 and CGL4, caused by mutations in the AGPAT2 and CAVIN1 genes, respectively. Two patients aged 2 and 9 years with the same biallelic CAVIN1 mutation and five patients aged between 6 months and 11 years 4 months with AGPAT2 mutations have been followed up for 3-9 years. The patients were between 7 and 20 years of age at their last examination. One of the two patients with CGL4 had congenital pyloric stenosis. The other patient with CGL4 have developed recurrent duodenal perforations which have not been reported in CGL patients previously. The pathological examination of duodenal specimens revealed increased subserosal fibrous tissue and absent submucosal adipose tissue. None of the five CGL1 patients had gastrointestinal problems. Two patients with CGL4 developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMP) and severe cardiac arrhythmia, only one patient with CGL1 had HCMP. Hyperinsulinemia was detected in one patient with CGL4 and three patients with CGL1, these three CGL1 patients also had acanthosis nigricans. Hepatic steatosis was detected in one patient with CGL4 and two patients with CGL1 by ultrasonography. In conclusion, these findings suggest that CGL4 patients should also be carefully followed up for gastrointestinal and cardiac manifestations.
