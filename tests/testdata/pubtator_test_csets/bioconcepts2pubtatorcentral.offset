8066824|t|Microvasculature in brain biopsy specimens from patients with Alzheimer's disease: an immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study.
8066824|a|Brain biopsy specimens from five patients with Alzheimer's disease obtained in the course of a trial of intracerebroventricular bethanechol were studied by immunohistochemical (antibody to A4 peptide) and ultrastructural techniques, with particular emphasis on the microvessels. In some cases, numbers of A4-immunoreactive lesions (senile plaques) correlated well with numbers of plaques demonstrable by silver stains. Prominent A4-immunoreactive amyloid angiopathy was seen in one patient. The patient with severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) showed extensive arteriolar deposition of amyloid filaments with apparent destruction of the media but remarkably intact endothelium. A cell of origin for amyloid filaments was not apparent, although close proximity to smooth muscle cell remnants in the arteriolar media suggested this as one possible cell of origin. Frequent vessels showed medial or adventitial collagen deposition, even when the amount of amyloid was minimal or negligible. Thus relatively severe CAA can exist in the absence of overt endothelial injury, although related studies on this tissue indicate definite abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier. Conversely, destruction of smooth muscle cells and collagen deposition in vessel walls may be the cellular correlates of arteriolar weakening that can lead to CAA-related brain hemorrhage.

18264009|t|Cognitive impairment no dementia - neuropsychological and neuroimaging characterization of an amnestic subgroup.
18264009|a|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) describes individuals whose cognitive functioning falls below normal but who do not meet dementia criteria. An important goal within CIND is to identify subgroups that will predictably progress to Alzheimer disease. CIND with amnestic deficits has been associated with high risk of Alzheimer disease but has until now been investigated on a retrospective basis. In this study a prospectively defined amnestic CIND group was characterized on a detailed neuropsychological test battery and on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. METHODS: Amnestic CIND was defined as meeting at least 1 but not all DSM-IV-TR criteria for dementia, scoring > or =1 SD below norms on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall, having a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 and a Mini-Mental State Exam score > or =24. This cross-sectional study compared subjects meeting these criteria (n = 25) to age- and education-matched controls (n = 26). The neuropsychological battery included memory and nonmemory measures that were analyzed as continuous variables and dichotomized into impaired (> or =1 SD below controls) versus nonimpaired. MRI scans were evaluated with a global-brain volumetric measure [brain fractional ratio (BFR)] and with visually based medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) ratings. RESULTS: Amnestic CIND had neuropsychological impairment in the episodic memory domain and also in nonmemory domains. There were 80% of CIND subjects with multidomain impairment. The most clear-cut nonmemory impairment was in the verbal ability domain, with 64% of subjects affected and a moderate effect size (d = 0.7). On MRI, BFR was lower (74.5 +/- 4.6 vs. 75.5 +/- 4.4) and MTA higher (72 vs. 38% with MTA > or =1) in CIND than in control subjects. BFR correlated with MTA (r = -0.45) and with a composite memory score (r = 0.296). CONCLUSION: A prospective amnestic CIND grouping appears to identify individuals with a multidomain pattern of neuropsychological impairment and with both medial temporal lobe and global brain atrophy.

28221304|t|Outcome Measures in Myasthenia Gravis: Incorporation Into Clinical Practice.
28221304|a|The development of validated assessment tools for evaluating disease status and response to interventions in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) has been driven by clinical studies of emerging MG therapies. However, only a small proportion of MG-focused neurology practices have adopted these assessment tools for routine clinical use. This article reviews the suitability of 5 assessment instruments for incorporation into clinical practice, which should be driven by their ability to contribute to improved patient outcomes, and to be implemented within practice personnel and resource constraints. It is recommended that assessments based on both physician-evaluated and patient-reported outcomes be selected, to adequately evaluate both point-in-time symptom load and functional impact of MG symptoms over time. Provider resource allocation and reimbursement issues may be the most significant roadblocks to successful ongoing use of these tools; to that end, the addition of regular assessments to MG standards of care is recommended.

23122961|t|Targeting of XJB-5-131 to mitochondria suppresses oxidative DNA damage and motor decline in a mouse model of Huntington's disease.
23122961|a|Oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction are implicated in aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). Many naturally occurring antioxidants have been tested for their ability to correct for deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species, but often they lack specificity, are tissue variable, and have marginal efficacy in human clinical trials. To increase specificity and efficacy, we have designed a synthetic antioxidant, XJB-5-131, to target mitochondria. We demonstrate in a mouse model of HD that XJB-5-131 has remarkably beneficial effects. XJB-5-131 reduces oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA, maintains mitochondrial DNA copy number, suppresses motor decline and weight loss, enhances neuronal survival, and improves mitochondrial function. The findings poise XJB-5-131 as a promising therapeutic compound.

19763528|t|[Car driving ability of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease].
19763528|a|BACKGROUND: The following study presents in detail newly occurring changes in driving ability of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The caregivers of 30 patients with FTLD (20 with FTD, 10 with SD) and 26 matched patients with AD were interviewed on potential alterations in driving ability using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the patients 90% with FTLD and 58% with AD showed changes in driving behavior. In AD the predominating alteration was an unsteady style of driving with increased lack of orientation. Patients with FTLD presented an aggressive and risky style of driving including various traffic rule violations. Significant differences between the two groups were observed regarding speeding, disregarding red traffic lights, inappropriate behavior and driving despite being forbidden by the family Of the patients with FTLD 37% were responsible for at least one accident since disease onset in comparison to 19% of patients with AD (p=0.24). Most patients with AD showed a reasonable attitude to their change in driving behavior, however the majority of patients with FTLD showed a lack of understanding for the fact that their style of driving presented a potential risk and did not accept the need to stop driving (p=0.023). CONCLUSION: Patients with FTLD should cease driving as soon as possible in the course of the disease. With patients suffering from mild AD an individual assessment should be made.

12467823|t|Video-assisted thymectomy for myasthenia gravis: an update of a single institution experience.
12467823|a|OBJECTIVE: Video-assisted thymectomy was introduced in 1992 as a minimally invasive alternative for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. As experience with this technique is limited and follow-up short, we present this expanded and updated experience for purposes of validation of the technique. METHODS: Thirty-eight video-assisted thymectomies for myasthenia gravis were performed in our institution between March 1992 and March 2002. Two patients were lost to follow-up. We analyzed clinical results of 36 patients (14 males and 22 females) with a mean age of 41.2 years. Preoperative clinical staging was assessed by the newly recommended Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Classification. Clinical status at follow-up was assessed by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Postintervention Status classification. RESULTS: There was no perioperative mortality or long-term morbidity. One of 38 (2.6%) patients required conversion to limited thoracotomy for bleeding. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.64 days (range 0-8 days) with a median stay of 1 day. The mean length of follow-up is 53.24 months (range 4-126 months). Overall clinical improvement at follow-up was observed in 30 of 36 (83.0%) patients, with five of 36 (14.0%) patients in complete stable remission. CONCLUSIONS: Video-assisted thymectomy for myasthenia gravis provides acceptable clinical long-term results by a minimally invasive approach comparable to standard surgical approaches to the disease. The presented data is reported in accordance with the new guidelines by Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Task Force for valid comparison with future studies.

32600496|t|New onset severe right ventricular failure associated with COVID-19 in a young infant without previous heart disease.
32600496|a|We present our recent experience with a 6-month-old infant with a personal history of short bowel syndrome that presented with fever, cyanosis, and cardiogenic shock secondary to severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure without pulmonary thromboembolism. He did not present signs of toxin-mediated disease or Kawasaki disease. He was finally diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. If this presentation is confirmed in future research, the severe cardiovascular impairment in children with COVID-19 could be also attributable to the primary pulmonary infection, not only to a multisystem inflammatory syndrome but also in children without heart disease.

23160423|t|Enhancing clinical trials in neurodegenerative disorders:  lessons from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
23160423|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review article is focused on strategies that may enhance clinical trial efficiency in neurodegenerative disorders, as demonstrated within the research field of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). RECENT FINDINGS: Unravelling ALS pathophysiology will result in an increased number of candidate therapeutics. Recent ALS clinical trials have employed novel study designs that expedite the drug development process and limit sample size, including futility, lead-in, selection, adaptive and sequential designs. The search for sensitive and specific biomarkers in ALS continues to develop, and they are essential in accelerating the drug discovery process. Several candidate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), neuroimaging and electrophysiological biomarkers have been recently described in ALS, and some have been successfully employed as secondary outcome measures in clinical trials. The advent of web-based technologies has provided a complementary platform to expedite clinical trials, through electronic data capture, teleconferencing and online registries. In addition, the formation of ALS consortia has enhanced collaborative multicentre studies. SUMMARY: ALS research studies have employed novel strategies to accelerate the efficiency and pace of drug discovery. The importance of adapting to novel measures that enhance study efficiency is not unique to ALS and can be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases in search of effective treatments.

3881207|t|Abnormal regulation of venous alanine after glucose ingestion in myotonic dystrophy.
3881207|a|The concentration of amino acids in whole blood was measured before and during standard 5 h oral glucose tolerance testing in six male patients with myotonic dystrophy and five normal males. The plasma levels of insulin and glucose were also determined. From 90 to 240 min after glucose ingestion there was a striking decline in venous alanine concentration in the patients with myotonic dystrophy in contrast to a slight rise in alanine in the normal group. The patients displayed normal glucose tolerance, and there was a sustained fall in the venous concentration of the insulin-sensitive amino acids comparable with that seen in the normal controls. However, the patients showed a threefold increase of plasma insulin after glucose. These data indicate an abnormal regulation of alanine in myotonic dystrophy which may be the result of an alteration in muscle synthesis of this amino acid. This defect in alanine synthesis may be due to a decreased availability of intracellular pyruvate caused by the insulin resistance that exists in these patients.

32780290|t|The microbial coinfection in COVID-19.
32780290|a|The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel beta-coronavirus, is the main pathogenic agent of the rapidly spreading pneumonia called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 infects much more people, especially the elder population, around the world than other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is challenging current global public health system. Beyond the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, microbial coinfection plays an important role in the occurrence and development of SARS-CoV-2 infection by raising the difficulties of diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of COVID-19, and even increasing the disease symptom and mortality. We summarize the coinfection of virus, bacteria and fungi with SARS-CoV-2, their effects on COVID-19, the reasons of coinfection, and the diagnosis to emphasize the importance of microbial coinfection in COVID-19. KEY POINTS:   Microbial coinfection is a nonnegligible factor in COVID-19.   Microbial coinfection exacerbates the processes of the occurrence, development and prognosis of COVID-19, and the difficulties of clinical diagnosis and treatment.   Different virus, bacteria, and fungi contributed to the coinfection with SARS-CoV-2.

30043511|t|A Semi-Mechanistic Population Pharmacokinetic Model of Nusinersen: An Antisense Oligonucleotide for the Treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy.
30043511|a|A pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed for nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that is the first approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The model was built with data from 92 nonhuman primates (NHPs) following intrathecal doses (0.3-7 mg) and characterized the PK in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, total spinal cord, brain, and pons. The estimated volumes were 13.6, 937, 4.5, 53.8, and 2.11 mL, respectively. Global sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the CSF-to-plasma drug distribution rate (0.09 hour-1 ) is a major determinant of the maximum nusinersen concentration in central nervous system (CNS) tissues. Physiological age-based and body weight-based allometric scaling was implemented with exponent values of -0.08 and 1 for the rate constants and the volume of distribution, respectively. Simulations of the scaled model were in agreement with clinical observations from 52 pediatric phase I PK profiles. The developed model can be used to guide the design of clinical trials with ASOs.

12820329|t|Ki-67 proliferation-index (MIB-1) of neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1 patients.
12820329|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the proliferation rate of neurofibromas, in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients in order to find out whether tumor growth can be correlated with the different subtypes, size and localisation of tumors, or gender. Large tumors and those localisations that do not allow a complete resection, e.g. the trigeminal branch plexiform neurofibromas, often require repeated surgical interventions. Therefore, the question whether partial resection is associated with alterations of the tumor type and proliferation is of great interest. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated 317 specimens of 96 patients. Twenty-five specimens were identified as local recurrences, all of them being consecutive resections in the previously operated area. All patients were NF 1-affected individuals who fulfilled the US National Institute of Health consensus criteria for defining the disease. The proliferation index (PI) was assessed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue stained with the MIB- 1 antibody (Ki-67 antigen). The PI was evaluated in three high-power fields (0.1 square millimeter) in the area with the highest proliferative activity. The correlations were calculated according to Spearman-Rho. RESULTS: Men were more often surgically treated in the head and neck than women (p < 0.02). Plexiform neurofibromas were more frequently operated on in the head and neck than in other regions (p < 0.01). Older patients were more often treated for the diffuse cutaneous type of neurofibromas (p < 0.0001). The type of tumor did not differ from primaries to recurrent tumors. The MIB- 1 PI showed no association with any of the clinical parameters. In particular, there was no difference of the MIB-1 index between primaries and recurrent tumors. DISCUSSION: This study showed, for the first time, that proliferation in neurofibromas is not enhanced in previously partially resected neurofibromas. Hence, the argument that trauma or surgery for neurofibromas might promote proliferation, especially in the plexiform neurofibroma, is not supported by the results of the present study. Further this analysis demonstrated interdependencies between tumor type, localisation, age and gender indicative of the social difficulties encountered by the NF1 patients which may be helpful for the advising practitioner.

17633106|a|A 74-year-old man developed instability of gait from age 64, difficulty in writing from age 66 and dysarthria-hypohidrosis from around age 67. These symptoms progressed slowly accompanied with orthostatic hypotension and dysarthria, which decline his ADL. At age 71, he was admitted to our hospital and underwent nasogastric intubation. After admission, he also showed the decrease in his voluntary activities, accidental ingestion and loud snoring during sleep. He died of accidental aspiration pneumonia at age 74. Postmortem examination revealed severe pathological changes as multiple system atrophy (MSA) in the central nervous system. There was a small ulcer in the hypopharyngeal region, and acute inflammation of the ulcer came down to the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle. Combined with severe neurogenic atropy due to MSA, local inflammation of the ulcer associated with nasogastric intubation appeared to have resulted in severe damage of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle.

20394760|t|Biomarkers in translational research of Alzheimer's disease.
20394760|a|The identification and characterization of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau as the main pathological substrates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have driven many efforts in search for suitable biomarkers for AD. In the last decade, research in this area has focused on developing a better understanding of the principles that govern protein deposition, mechanisms that link aggregation to toxicity and neuronal death, and a better understanding of protein dynamics in brain tissue, interstitial fluid and CSF. While Abeta and tau represent the two key pathological mediators of disease, other aspects of this multifaceted disease (e.g. oxidative stress, calcium-mediated toxicity, and neuroinflammation) are being unraveled, with the hope to develop a more comprehensive approach in exploring disease mechanisms. This has not only expanded possible areas for disease-modifying therapies, but has also allowed the introduction of novel, and potentially useful, fluid and radiological markers for the presence and progression of AD pathology. There is no doubt that the identification of several fluid and imaging biomarkers that can reliably detect the early stages of AD will have great implications in the design of clinical trials, in the selection of homogenous research populations, and in the assessment of disease outcomes. Markers with good diagnostic specificity will aid researchers in differentiating individuals with preclinical and probable AD from individuals who do not have AD pathology or have other dementing disorders. Markers that change with disease progression may offer utility in assessing the rates of disease progression and the efficacy of potential therapeutic agents on AD pathology. For both of these purposes, CSF Abeta42, amyloid imaging, and CSF tau appear to be very good markers of the presence of AD pathology as well as predictive of who will progress from MCI to AD. Volumetric MRI is also good at separating individuals with MCI and AD from controls and is predictive of who will progress from MCI to AD. Perhaps the most important role biomarkers will have, and the most needed at this time, lies in the identification of individuals who are cognitively normal, and yet have evidence of AD pathology (i.e. preclinical AD). Such individuals, it appears, can be identified with CSF Abeta42, amyloid imaging, and CSF tau. Such individuals are the most likely to benefit from future disease modifying/prevention therapies as they become available, and therefore represent the population in which the field can make the biggest therapeutic impact.

28756309|t|Activation of brain glucose metabolism ameliorating cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by electroacupuncture.
28756309|a|An essential feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is implicated in brain energy metabolic impairment that is considered underlying pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Therefore, therapeutic interventions to allay cognitive deficits that target energy metabolism may be an efficacy strategy in AD. In this study, we found that electroacupuncture (EA) at the DU20 acupoint obviously increased glucose metabolism in specific brain regions such as cortex, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, basal forebrain septum, brain stem, and cerebellum in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by animal 18F-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-Glucose (18F-FDG)/positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, accompanied by cognitive improvements in the spatial reference learning and memory and memory flexibility and novel object recognition performances. Further evidence shown energy metabolism occurred in neurons or non-neuronal cells of the cortex and hippocampus in terms of the co-location of GLUT3/NeuN and GLUT1/GFAP. Simultaneously, metabolic homeostatic factors were critical for glucose metabolism, including phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AKT serine/threonine kinase. Furthermore, EA-induced phosphorylated AMPK and AKT inhibited the phosphorylation level of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to decrease the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the cortex and hippocampus. These findings are concluded that EA is a potential therapeutic target for delaying memory decline and Abeta deposition of AD. The AMPK and AKT are implicated in the EA-induced cortical and hippocampal energy metabolism, which served as a contributor to improving cognitive function and Abeta deposition in a transgenic mouse model of AD.

30336374|t|Autopsy case of right ventricular rhabdomyoma in tuberous sclerosis complex.
30336374|a|Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic multisystem disorder characterized by widespread hamartomas in several organs, including the brain, heart, skin, eyes, kidney, lung, and liver. Rhabdomyoma is the most common cardiac tumor diagnosed in fetuses, neonates and infants, and is closely linked to TSC. Here we describe an autopsy case of right ventricular rhabdomyoma in TSC. The deceased was a 3-month-old male infant, and TSC with a cardiac tumor had been diagnosed before his death. Since the cardiac tumor had not been physically blocking the blood flow, he had not undergone surgical intervention. At autopsy, the patient's height was 62 cm and his body weight was 6 kg. The heart weighed 37.3 g and the right ventricle was filled with the tumor. The tumor measured 2.1 cm x 1.6 cm, being a fusion of multiple tumors with several attachment sites to the myocardium. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a rhabdomyoma, and was positive for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The brain weighed 795.0 g, without hydrocephalus. The cut surface of the brain revealed multiple cortical tubers and subependymal nodules. Through screening for the TSC1 (hamartin) and TSC2 (tuberin) genes, a nonsense mutation, c.1108C>T:p.Gln370*, was detected in the TSC2 gene. Immediate cause of death was determined to be ventricular obstruction by a cardiac rhabdomyoma with insidious growth. This case highlights the need for forensic pathologists to perform a complete autopsy to determine the cause of sudden death with cardiac tumor, including genetic examination.

26061669|t|Multimodal Discrimination of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Regional Cortical Atrophy and Hypometabolism.
26061669|a|Structural MR image (MRI) and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) have been widely employed in diagnosis of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) pathology, which has led to the development of methods to distinguish AD and MCI from normal controls (NC). Synaptic dysfunction leads to a reduction in the rate of metabolism of glucose in the brain and is thought to represent AD progression. FDG-PET has the unique ability to estimate glucose metabolism, providing information on the distribution of hypometabolism. In addition, patients with AD exhibit significant neuronal loss in cerebral regions, and previous AD research has shown that structural MRI can be used to sensitively measure cortical atrophy. In this paper, we introduced a new method to discriminate AD from NC based on complementary information obtained by FDG and MRI. For accurate classification, surface-based features were employed and 12 predefined regions were selected from previous studies based on both MRI and FDG-PET. Partial least square linear discriminant analysis was employed for making diagnoses. We obtained 93.6% classification accuracy, 90.1% sensitivity, and 96.5% specificity in discriminating AD from NC. The classification scheme had an accuracy of 76.5% and sensitivity and specificity of 46.5% and 89.6%, respectively, for discriminating MCI from AD. Our method exhibited a superior classification performance compared with single modal approaches and yielded parallel accuracy to previous multimodal classification studies using MRI and FDG-PET.

11526627|a|Neurofibromatosis are frequent genetic syndromes, with the electrooculographic examination (EOG) as an useful tool in their evaluation. We present the EOG findings of 16 patients with this entity which were seen at our Department between 1969 and 1991. Mean of age was 31 years. Nine patients were female (56%). The most frequent pathologic findings were: spontaneous nystagmus (37.5%) and abnormalities in the pursuit tracking test (31.2%). These results are discussed and the main literature concerning this matter is reviewed.

29880811|t|Loss of Drosha underlies dopaminergic neuron toxicity in models of Parkinson's disease.
29880811|a|MiRNAs, a group of powerful modulator of gene expression, participate in multiple cellular processes under physiological and pathological conditions. Emerging evidence shows that Drosha, which controls the initial step in canonical miRNA biogenesis, is involved in modulating cell survival and death in models of several diseases. However, the role of Drosha in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been well established. Here, we show that the level of Drosha decreases in 6-OHDA-induced cellular and animal models of PD. 6-OHDA induced a p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of Drosha. This triggered Drosha degradation. Enhancing the level of Drosha protected the dopaminergic (DA) neurons from 6-OHDA-induced toxicity in both in vitro and in vivo models of PD and alleviated the motor deficits of PD mice. These findings reveal that Drosha plays a critical role in the survival of DA neurons and suggest that stress-induced destabilization of Drosha may be part of the pathological process in PD.

24529525|t|The incretin hormones glucagonlike peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide are neuroprotective in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.
24529525|a|The incretin hormones glucagonlike peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) have been developed to treat type 2 diabetes and also act as growth factors. We have tested several long-acting incretin mimetics in the amyloid precursor protein (APP)(Swe)/presenilin 1 (PS1)(DeltaE9) model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that liraglutide, lixisenatide, and D-Ala2-GIP cross the blood-brain barrier and prevent the impairment in memory formation and synaptic plasticity, increase synapse numbers, reduce amyloid plaque load and soluble amyloid-beta levels, reduce oxidative stress and the chronic inflammation response in the brain, enhance the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells, and increase neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. In an (18)fluorodeoxyglucoe positron emission tomographic/computed tomographic imaging study in PLB1-triple mice, a mouse model that expresses human mutated APP, PS1, and tau proteins, glucose metabolism was found to be normalized in forebrain areas after liraglutide treatment, demonstrating that neuronal metabolic activity was normalized. A clinical trial testing liraglutide in patients with AD is currently ongoing.

163811|t|Isolation and characterization of catabolite-resistant mutants in the D-serine deaminase system of Escherichia coli K-12.
163811|a|Two classes of D-serine deaminase (Dsdase)-specific secondary mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 were isolated from a Dsdase low constitutive nonhyperinducible mutant as types which could grow in the presence of both D-serine and glucose. These strains contain cis dominant, nonsuppressible mutations in the dsdO (operator-initiator) region. In the first class of mutants (e.g., FB4010), Dsdase synthesis is completely insensitive to catabolite repression, and synthesis occurs at a high constitutive rate in the absence of cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate. In the second class (e.g., FB4005), Dsdase synthesis is partially insensitive to catabolite repression, and catabolite repression is reversed by the addition of cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate. Dsdase synthesis in strain FB4005 is partially independent of the cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate binding protein, as constitutive synthesis is reduced only 65% (relative to the cap+ strain) in strains unable to synthesize the cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate binding protein. Surprisingly, the constitutive rate of Dsdase synthesis is fourfold higher in all mutants of both classes than in the parent, indicating a close interrelationship between the sites of response to induction and catabolite repression.

163812|t|Effect of tsl mutations in decreasing radiation sensitivity of a recA- strain of Escherichia coli K-12.
163812|a|It has been shown previously that the radiation sensitivity of lexA- strains of Escherichia coli K-12 can be suppressed by thermosensitive mutations (designated tsl) that are closely linked to the lexA locus and are thought to be intragenic suppressors of lexA mutations (Mount et al., 1973). When a recA mutation is crossed into a suppressed tsl- strain, the extreme radiation sensitivity usually conferred by a recA mutation is decreased, but there is no detectable change in genetic recombination deficiency. Increased resistance to UV in the tsl-reA-strains depends upon ability to synthesize active uvrA+ product.

163813|t|Isolation of a catabolite repression mutant of yeast as a revertant of a strain that is maltose negative in the respiratory-deficient state.
163813|a|A character originating from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 1403-7A is described which interferes with maltose growth in the respiratory-deficient state. This character is inherited in an apparently non-Mendelian way, but at present no statement can be made concerning the localization of this character on a plasmid or the involvement of multiple genes. As a revertant of this character, a flaky mutant was isolated, showing a heavy flocculation during growth on liquid medium and resistance to catabolite repression for maltase, alpha-methyl-glucosidase, invertase, and succinate dehydrogenase. In wild-type cells, repression (caused by growth on 2% glucose) and derepression (caused by growth on 2% galactose) can be correlated with a lower and a higher level of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), respectively. In cells of flaky mutant, growth on these carbon sources results in the same levels of cAMP as observed for the wild type. Consequently, in this mutant derepression in the presence of 2% glucose is not reflected in a higher level of cAMP.

163814|a|The differential rate of synthesis of five of the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes coded for by pyrB-F, and the endogenous concentrations of the individual pyrimidine nucleotides were determined in specially constructed mutants of Salmonella typhimurium. In the mutants employed the different pyrimidine nucleotide pools may be manipulated individually during exponential growth. The results obtained indicate the following. (i) The expression of pyrB, pyrE, and pyrF is controlled by a uridine nucleotide in a noncoordinate manner. (ii) The expression of pyrC and pyrD is regulated predominantly by a cytidine nucleotide. Under all conditions investigated, their expression seems to be coordinated, even though the genes are not contiguous on the chromosome. (iii) The low-molecular-weight effectors involved in controlling the expression of the pyr genes are neither uridine 5'-monophosphate nor cytidine 5'-monophosphate, but rather the corresponding di- or triphosphates.

163815|t|Regulatory factors affecting alpha-amylase production in bacillus licheniformis.
163815|a|Possible factors regulating alpha-mylase synthesis in wild-type Bacillus licheniformis and in mutants producing elevated levels of the enzyme were studied in terms of catabolite repression, apparent temperature-sensitive repression, induction, and culture age. The synthesis of alpha-amylase in the parent strain occurred long after the culture reached the stationary phase of growth as a result of de novo protein synthesis, occurred only at high temperature around 50 C and not below 45 C, appeared to be induced in the presence of oligosaccharides with some linkage of alpha-1,4-, beta-1,4, beta-1,6-glucosyl glucose, or alpha-1,6-galactosyl glucose, and was repressed by the addition of exogenous glucose or low-molecular-weight metabolites. The addition of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate stimulated alpha-amylase accumulation in growing cultures of the parent strain, but neither shortened the long lap period prior to the start of alpha-amylase synthesis nor mitigated the repressive effect of glucose. Mutant strains derived from the parent strain showed variation in the pattern of alpha-amylase synthesis, and some of them such as F-12s and F-14 produced alpha-amylase constitutively and without sensitivity to catabolite repression or transient repression from the moment of cell growth. These results are discussed in relation to possible regulatory mechanisms that might account for the observed characteristics of alpha-amylase synthesis in this facultative thermophilic microorganism.

163816|t|Kinectics of beta-galactosidase synthesis in Escherichia coli at 5 C.
163816|a|The defect in protein synthesis that is observed in Escherichia coli after transfer to low temperature was studied. For the enzyme beta-galactosidase, the elongation reactions of transcription and translation can take place slowly but normally at 5 C. The time necessary to complete the coupled synthesis of the beta-galactosidase messenger ribonucleic acid and polypeptide chain was found to be about 80 min at 5 C. From this result and from the known length of the beta-galactosidase monomer, it is possible to calculate that at 5 C one amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain every 4 s. The initiation of transcription of the beta-galactosidase messenger is inhibited after transfer to 5 C. This fact alone, however, cannot account for all of the phenomena observed at 5 C, because a given amount of messenger yields less enzyme at 5 C than it does at 37 C. Furthermore, in cells induced for short periods at 37 C, the capacity to synthesize beta-galactosidase after transfer to 5 C was found to accumulate linearily with the square of the time of induction. Two alternative models could account for these data. If all ribosomes that initiate translation at 37 C yield complete beta-galactosidase polypeptide chains at 5 C, then an inhibition of translation initiation after transfer to 5 C must be invoked to explain the results. If, on the other hand, a substantial portion of the ribosomes that initiate translation at 37 C do not yield complete beta-galactosidase polypeptides at 5 C, then intracistronic polarity could account for the data, and there is no need to invoke an inhibition of translation initiation at 5 C.

163817|t|6-Phosphogluconate dehydratase deficiency in pleiotropic carbohydrate-negative mutant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
163817|a|Mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strain PAO, have been isolated that are unable to grow on mannitol, glucose, gluconate, or 2-ketogluconate, cut that exhibit wild-type growth on pyruvate, lactate, citrate, succinate, or acetate. Although some of these mutants were also unable to grow on glycerol, the mutations formed a single linkage group by quantitative transductional analysis with phage F116 on glucose minimal agar medium. Cell extracts of all mutant strains were either lacking or severely deficient in 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase activity. Glu+ transductants derived from mutant strains that retained the wild-type ability for growth at the expense of glycerol also regained the ability to grow on all C-6 compounds. Although a role for the pentose phosphate pathway in the catabolism of C6 substrates was not found, a functional Entner-Doudoroff pathway appears to be essential for the catabolism of mannitol, glucose, gluconate, and 2-ketogluconate.

163818|t|Biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids in yeast: effect of carbon source on leucine biosynthetic enzymes.
163818|a|The three enzymes in the leucine biosynthetic pathway of yeast do not exhibit coordinate repression and derepression in response to the carbon source available in the culture medium. Growth in an acetate medium results in derepression of the first enzyme in the pathway, alpha-isopropylmalate synthase, and repression of the second two enzymes, alpha-isopropylmalate isomerase and beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, relative to the levels found in glucose-grown cells. The role of endogenous leucine pools as a mediator of these differences was investigated. The leucine pools did not differ significantly between acetate-grown and glucose-grown cells. However, an elevated endogenous leucine pool, caused by exogenous leucine in the growth medium, did decrease the rate of decay of alpha-isopropylmalate synthase activity observed when acetate-grown cells were shifted to glucose. Evidence is provided suggesting that an elevated endogenous leucine pool may increase the in vivo stability of alpha-isopropylmalate synthase under several different conditions. Studies on the kinetics of alpha-isopropylmalate synthase decay in vivo and sensitivity to leucine inhibition indicate that there are two classes of the enzyme in acetate-grown yeast cells.

163819|t|Regulation of dihydrodipicolinate synthase and aspartate kinase in Bacillus subtilis.
163819|a|The regulation of dihydrodipicolinate synthase (EC 4.2.1.52) and aspartate kinase (EC 2.7.2.4) was studied in Bacillus subtilis 168. Starvation for lysine gave depression of one aspartate kinase isoenzyme but not of dihydrodipicolinate synthase. Strains resistant to growth inhibition by the lysine analogue thiosine exhibited constitutively derepressed synthesis of one aspartate kinase isoenzyme but had normal levels of dihydrodipicolinate synthase. The data provide strong evidence that lysine is not the signal for derepression of dihydrodipicolinate synthase. Nevertheless, dihydrodipicolinate synthase specific activity increased during sporulation, and it is suggested that this increase may result, in part, from resistance to proteolysis of that enzyme.

163820|t|Coenzyme interaction with horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase. Evidence for allosteric coenzyme binding sites from thermodynamic equilibrium studies.
163820|a|The techniques of fluorescence enhancement, fluorescence quenching, fluorescence polarization, and equilibrium dialysis are utilized to study the binding properties of coenzyme to horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase. Polarization of fluorescence and equilibrium dialysis show that NADH binds to alcohol dehydrogenase with a stoichiometry of 6 mol per mol of enzyme, in contrast to the value of 2 determined from fluorescence enhancement measurements. NAD+ also binds with a stoichiometry of six as was determined by equilibrium dialysis. The two NADH sites which bind coenzyme more tightly and which are revealed by fluorescence enhancement measurements are designated the catalytic sites. Binding of coenzyme to the four ancillary sites does not alter the quantum yield of NADH but results in a 20% contribution to quenching of enzyme's tryptophan fluorescence. From the emission anisotropy of bound NADH of 24.0% for the additional sites and 28.1% for the catalytic sites and their relative fluorescence lifetimes at the same wavelengths of excitation and emmision, we conclude that the nicotinamide ring of NADH bound to the additional sites exhibits a freedom of motion independent of the macromolecule, while that bound to the catalytic sites is more rigidly held. Polarization of fluorescence yields negative intrinsic free energies of 9.2 and 7.5 Cal M-1 for NADH interaction with the catalytic and additional sites, respectively. Although these values are 1.3 to 2.0 Cal higher than those determined by fluorescence quenching and equilibrium dialysis, the mean Hill coefficient of 1.76 plus or minus 0.06, the titration span of 2.4 logarithmic units and coupling free energies (in magnitude and sign) are the same for all these techniques. The above difference in the intrinsic free energies are attributed largely to the different modes of interaction of excited and unexcited NADH molecules with alcohol dehydrogenase.

163821|t|A study of the cytoplasmic receptors for glucocorticoids in intestine of pre- and postweanling rats.
163821|a|Glucocorticoids cause both enzymic and morphologic changes in the rat intestine during the time of weaning. To obtain information regarding the mechanism of these actions, we examined the cytoplasmic fraction of intestines from 18-day-old rats for the presence of specific glucocorticoid-binding proteins which are characteristics of target tissues. Incubation of slices of intestine with [3H]dexamethasone in a physiological medium at 2 degrees showed the presence of a cytoplasmic binding macromolecule with high specificity for steroids having glucocorticoid activity. The binding reaction was saturable (concentration of binding sites equals 0.24 pmol per mg of protein) and of high affinity (dissociation constant equals 9.3 nM). Binding was reversible on addition of nonlabeled dexamethasone (t 1/2 equals 5.2 hours), indicating that the usual assay procedure measured both corticosterone-filled and unoccupied binding sites. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation showed that the receptor-dexamethasone complex from intestinal cytosol sedimented at the same rate as that from liver (8.2 S). The receptor-dexamethasone complex was stable at 2 degrees for at least 24 hours in intestinal slices, but in isolated cytosol fractions there was considerable loss of binding even in the presence of high concentrations of [3H]dexamethasone. Furthermore, mixing experiments showed that the presence of cytosol from intestinal mucosa (but not from the muscle layers) caused a dissociation of dexamethasone from receptors of liver cytosol. This suggested the presence of some interfering factor in isolated mucosal cytosol and meant that quantitative studies had to be confined to intact slices. Although the reasons for the instability of steroid-receptor complexes in the presence of isolated intestinal cytosol are not understood, the instability is believed to be associated with homogenization and, therefore, is believed to have no physiological significance. Finally, the ontogenesis of cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors in intestinal slices was examined and the pattern compared with that in liver and lung. Receptor activity was present in intestine from late fetal life through adulthood, but concentrations were significantly higher during the first two postnatal weeks than at all other times. By contrast, receptor activity detected in cytosol prepared from rat lung was high around the time of birth, while that in liver rose steadily during the first postnatal week and remained at high levels. Thus specific receptors for glucocorticoids are present in the rat intestine during periods of both responsiveness and unresponsiveness. This suggests that although corticosteroids exert their effects through the cytoplasmic receptors, this early event in glucocorticoid action may not be a controlling step for changes in responsiveness during development.

TFms also has the capacity to stimulate RNA synthesis without ppGpp present. Under standard conditions the action TFms and ppGpp requires uncharged tRNA. TFms and ppGpp act at inhibition to promote the formation of rifampicin-resistant or polytrI)-resistant preinitiation complexes. In the presence of rifampicin or poly(rI), tRNA is no longer required. With lambdah80dlacPs DNA as template, ppGpp together with TFms stimulated gal RNA synthesis to a much greater extent than total RNA synthesis. The stimulation of both lac and gel RNA synthesis was increased in the presence of cyclic AMP receptor and cyclic AMP.

163823|t|A persistent active state of the adenylate cyclase system produced by the combined actions of isoproterenol and guanylyl imidodiphosphate in frog erythrocyte membranes.
163823|a|Isoproterenol plus guanylyl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) activate frog erythrocyte adenylate cyclase to a level much higher than the sum of the activities produced by the catecholamine and the synthetic nucleotide tested separately. Propranolol, the beta-receptor blocking agent,  failed to inhibit activity when added after the enzyme system had been preincubated with both isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p. However, if propranolol was added after only one of the two components had been added, it inhibited the effect of isoproterenol. Production of the propranolol-resistant state by treatment with isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p did not require the presence of the productive substrate (MgATP). The activated propranolol-resistant state persisted following various treatments of the enzyme preparation including extensive washings of the membranes; considerable activity was retained even after sonication or treatment with the detergent Lubrol-PX, treatments which caused inactivation of the native enzyme. Extensive dilution of the membranes following pretreatment with isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p did not significantly reduce to the activity of the enzyme. Readdition of isoproterenol after dilution caused some inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, indicating apparently that the beta-receptor has not become inaccessible. In contrast, preincubation with isoproterenol alone failed to render the enzyme system refractive to propranolol, and dilution readily reduced the activity to negligibly low values. Preincubation with Gpp(NH)p alone also produced a persistent active state but the activity was much lower than that obtained throught the combined action of isoproterenol and Gpp(NH)p. The findings suggest that the hormone may be required only to facilitate the initial interaction of the enzyme with Gpp(NH)p. The differences, in this respect, between Gpp(NH)p and the more labile natural nucleotide, GTP, are discussed.

Removal of a peptide containing the critical serine residue gave phosphorylase b' from which the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in phosphorylase has an important effect on enzymic interconversion.

163825|t|The plane of cleavage in human ferrihemoglobin. I. Ultraviolet difference spectroscopy.
163825|a|X-ray diffraction studies have shown that hemoglobin has two predominant interfaces in the tetramer at which dissociation to dimers could occur. These interfaces have been designed as alpha1-beta1 and alpha1-beta2. There are 2 tyrosyl residues and 1 tryptophanyl residue in the alpha1-beta2- interface but only 1 tyrosyl residue in the alpha1-beta1 interface exposed to the solvent are perturbed. The ultraviolet difference spectrum between ferrihemoglobin dissociated in 1 M NaClO4 and undissociated hemoglobin revealed two negative peaks, one at 292.5 nm and another at 285 nm. This difference spectrum is due to tyrosyl and tryptophanyl residues which reside on the plane of cleavage and were exposed to 1 M NaClO4 upon dissociation. Hence, dissociation must have occurred along the alpha1-beta2 interface to yield alpha1 beta1 dimers. The deltaF degrees value extrapolated to zero salt concentration calculated on the basis of difference spectroscopy and sedimentation velocity experiments is 8.6 plus or minus 0.7 kcal per mol at pH 7.1 (K equals 4.5 times 10-7.

163826|t|Stimulation of active uptake of nucleosides and amino acids by cyclic adenosine 3' :5'-monophosphate in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
163826|a|In conditions of glucose starvation, the maximum velocity of the mediated transport of nonmetabolized and metabolized amino acids, uridine, adenosine, and sucrose across the plasma membrane is stimulated by a factor of two by the addition of 1 mM adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate to Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h- wild strain, to the glucose-super-repressed and derepressed mutants COB5 and COB6, and to Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain IL 216-IA. The mediated uptake of 2-D-deoxyglucose and the apparently nonmediated uptake of guanosine are not stimulated by the cyclic nucleotide. N6,O2'-Dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate is also efficient, whereas theophylline, guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate, 5'-AMP, ATP, and adenosine are ineffective. The cellular ATP content of glycerol-grown S. pombe COB5 is about 10 nmol per mg of protein and is not decreased by further incubation in the starvation medium. The addition of 100 mM glucose markedly enhances transport without any increase of the cellular ATP content. The addition of antimycin A or Dio-9 decreases markedly both cellular ATP content and transport. The addition of 2.5 mM glucose to antimycin A-containing medium restores both transport is not necessarily of mitochondrial origin. The uptake of 2-D-deoxyglucose is unaffected by the respiratory inhibitors. Stimulation of uptake by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate occurs only in glucose-deprived cells. The addition of 10 mM glucose elicits the disappearance of the stimulation and prevents the 30% decrease of the cellular adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate content produced by glucose starvation. Adenosine 3':5'-'monophosphate does not enhance the steady state ATP level but requires cellular ATP produced either by endogenous respiration or, in the absence of respiration blocked by antimycin A, by further addition of 2.5 mM glucose. Stimulation of active uptake by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate does not require protein synthesis because the addition of cycloheximide or anisomycin does not prevent the stimulation of L-leucine uptake. In the absence of respiration, Dio-9, and ATPase inhibitor, suppresses instantaneously the cellular ejection of protons as well as the uptake of uridine and amino acids. It abolishes also the adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-stimulated transport. In the presence of antimycin A, specific mitochondrial ATPase inhibitors such as venruricidin A do not inhibit metabolite uptakes and their stimulation by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. These results suggest that in these conditions, the target of Dio-9 is not the mitochondrial ATPase but a plasma membrane proton-translocating function generating an electrochemical gradient required for active transport. That adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate enhances the Dio-9-sensitive proton extrusion supports the view that the cyclic nucleotide might modulate the plasma membrane ATPase.

163827|t|The mechanism of stabilization of the structure of nuclease-T by binding of ligands.
163827|a|The rate of unfolding of Nuclease-T at pH 8,20 degrees was determined as a function of concentration of the ligands deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate (pdTp) and Ca2+ on the basis of the rate of exchange between free fragment, Nuclease-T(50-149) and labeled fragment, Nuclease-T-(50-149) incorporated in the structure of nuclease-T (Taniuchi, H. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5164-5174). The rate constant of unfolding of unliganded Nuclease-T' was 4.6 times 10-4s-1. Those of Nuclease-T' bound with pdTp, with Ca2+, and with both pdtp and Ca2+ were 9.0 times 10-5, 1.6 times 10-4, and 2.2 times 10-5s-1, respectively. The association constants of pdTp and Ca2+ with Nuclease-T' were found to be 1.0 times 10-4 and 2.0 times 10-2 m-1, respectively. Those of pdTp with Nuclease-T' plus Ca2+ and of Ca2+ with  Nuclease-T'  plus pdTp were 4 times 10-5 and 1.4 times 10-4M-1, respectively. The calculation of free energy change on the basis of the association constants shows that the magnitude of negative free energy change involved in the binding of either of the two ligands increases by approximately 2 kcal when the other ligand is already bound. There is a correlation between the free energy change and the specifically coupled with the cooperative interacions operating throught the three-dimensional structure resulting in strengthening of the interactions throughtout the structure, including those with the ligands, without a large change in conformation.

163829|t|Hapten-sandwich labeling. II. Immunospecific attachment of cell surface markers suitable for scanning electron microscopy.
163829|a|A hapten-sandwich procedure has been used for immunospecific labeling of cell surface antigens with markers visible by scanning electron microscopy. Antihapten antibody was used to link hapten-modified tobacco mosaic virus, bushy stunt virus, or hemocyanin to hapten-modified human erythrocytes. The antihapten antibody bridge was also used to link the hapten-virus marker to hapten-modified antibodies against mammary tumor virus on mouse mammary tumor cells, or against immunoglobulin receptors on mouse splenic lymphocytes. In all cases, labeling was highly specific. With this technique, it is possible to (a) compare morphological features of cells bearing differing cell surface antigens, and (b) examine the arrangement of specific antigenic sites on a cell surface or their distribution relative to membrane structures such as microvilli.

163830|t|Further characterization of embryonic tendon fibroblasts and the use of immunoferritin techniques to study collagen biosynthesis.
163830|a|Morphological studies were carried out on fibroblasts from chick embryo tendons, cells which have been used in a number of recent studies on collagen biosynthesis. The cells were relatively rich in endoplasmic reticulum and contained a well-developed Golgi complex comprised of small vesicles, stacked membranes, and large vacuoles. Techniques were then devised for preparing cell fragments which were penetrated by ferritin-antibody conjuates but which retained the essential morphological features of the cells. Finally, the new procedures were employed to develop further information as to how collagen is synthesized. As reported elsewhere, preliminary studies with ferritin-labeled antibodies showed that prolyl hydroxylase was found in the endoplasmic reticulum of freshly isolated fibroblasts and that procollagen is found in both the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum and the large Golgi vacuoles. In the experiments described here, the cells were manipulated so that amino acids continued to be incorporated into polypeptide chains but assembly of the molecule was not completed because hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues was prevented. The results indicated that these manipulations produced no change in the distribution of prolyl hydroxylase. Examination of the cells with ferritin conjugated to antibodies which reacted with protocollagen, the unhydroxylated form of procollagen, demonstrated that protocollagen was retained in the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum during inhibition of the prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases. Assays for prolyl hydroxylase with an immunologic technique demonstrated that although the enzyme is found within the endoplasmic reticulum, it is not secreted along with procollagen. The observations provided further evidence for a special role for prolyl hydroxylase in the control of collagen biosynthesis.

163831|t|Detection by means of cell fusion of macromolecular synthesis involved in the reconstruction of the nuclear envelope in mitosis.
163831|a|Using the cultured Chinese hamster cell line Don, G1 or S or a mixture of late-S/G2 cells were prepared by release from metaphase arrest. Metaphase (M) cells were also obtained by mitotic arrest of log-phase cultures with Colcemid and held in metaphase; such M cells remained untreated with any other compound and were termed standard M cells. When interphase (I) cells were fused at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C with standard cells in the presence of Colcemid by means of UV-inactivated Sendai virus, binucleate interphase-metaphase (I-M) cells were obtained. In a given I-M cell there occurred within 30 min after fusion either prophasing of the I nucleus or formation of a nuclear envelope (NE) around the chromosomes. About 20%  of early G1 cells, 35% of cells at the G1/S boundary, 50% of S cells, and 70% of late S/G2 cells could induce NE formation. If, before fusion, cycloheximide (CHE), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, was present during release from M arrest, the cells entered G1 but not S. About 20% of such early G1 cells, like the untreated early G1 cells, had the capacity to induce NE formation during subsequent fusion. If the cells were blocked in S with 5 mM thymidine (TdR), At least 80% of these cells could induce NE formation during subsequent fusion, but in the presence of both TdR and CHE only 35% could do so. It appeared, therefore, that protein synthesis in interphase was required for NE formation. Experiments with actinomycin D indicated that RNA synthesis was also necessary for acquisition of NE-inducing capacity. About 35% of G1 cells from confluent monolayers had the NE-inducing capacity, but prolonged exposure to CHE reduced their number to 8% . Removal of CHE restored the ability while the cells still remained in G1. This result indicated that continuing protein synthesis in the G1 cell was needed for NE formation subsequent to fusion. The fact that macromolecular synthesis must occur in the I cell before fusion if NE formation was to occur in the fused I-M cell lends further support to evidence adduced earlier that this phenomenon is a normal mitotic event. Prophasing of the I nucleus in I-M cells did not appear to be dependent on macromolecular synthesis in the I cell; earlier results from this laboratory showed, however, that protein synthesis in the prior G2 period of the M cell of the I-M pair was required for prophasing.

163832|t|Cell surface changes and Rous sarcoma virus gene expression in synchronized cells.
163832|a|We have investigated whether cell surface changes associated with growth control and malignant transformation are linked to the cell cycle. Chicken embryo cells synchronized by double thymidine block were examined for cell-cycle-dependent alterations in membrane function (measured by transport of 2-deoxyglucose, uridine, thymidine, and mannitol), in cell surface morphology (examined by scanning electron microscopy), and in the ability of tumor virus gene expression to induce a transformation-specific change in membrane function. We reach the following conclusions: (a) The high rate of 2-deoxyglucose transport seen in transformed cells and the low rates of 2-deoxyglucose and uridine transport characteristic of density-inhibited cells do not occur in normal growing cells as they traverse the cell cycle. (b) Although there are cell cycle-dependent changes in surface morphology, they are not reflected in corresponding changes in membrane function. (c) Tumor virus gene expression can alter cell membrane function at any stage in the cell cycle and without progression through the cell cycle.

163833|t|Externally disposed plasma membrane proteins. I. Enzymatic iodination of mouse L cells.
163833|a|The enzymatic iodination technique has been utilized in a study of the externally disposed membrane proteins of the mouse L cell. Iodination of cells in suspension results in lactoperoxidase-specific iodide incorporation with no loss of cell viability under the conditions employed, less than 3% lipid labeling, and more than 90% of the labeled species identifiable as monoiodotyrosine. 90% of the incorporated label is localized to the cell surface by electron microscope autoradiography, with 5-10% in the centrosphere region and postulated to represent pinocytic vesicles. Sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gels of solubilized L-cell proteins reveals five to six labeled peaks ranging from 50,000 to 200,000 daltons. Increased resolution by use of gradient slab gels reveals 15-20 radioactive bands. Over 60% of the label resides in approximately nine polypeptides of 80,000 to 150,000 daltons. Various controls indicate that the labeling pattern reflects endogenous membrane proteins, not serum components. The incorporated 125-I, cholesterol, and one plasma membrane enzyme marker, alkaline phosphodiesterase I, are purified in parallel when plasma membranes are isolated from intact, iodinated L cells. The labeled components present in a plasma membrane-rich fraction from iodinated cells are identical to those of the total cell, with a 10- to 20-fold enrichment in specific activity of each radioactive peak in the membrane.

163834|t|Externally disposed plasma membrane proteins. II. Metabolic fate of iodinated polypeptides of mouse L cells.
163834|a|The fate of the L-cell plasma membrane proteins labeled by enzymatic iodination was studied. The disappearance of label from growing cells exhibits a biphasic behavior, with 5-20% lost rapidly (t1/2 similar to 2 h) and 80-90% lost relatively slowly (t1/2 similar to 25-33 h). The loss is temperature dependent and serum independent, and is accompanied by the appearance of 51% (125-I)monoiodotyrosine (MIT) in the medium by 47 h. A variable amount (1-14%) of acid-insoluble label can be recovered in the medium over 47 h. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel labeling patterns from cells cultured up to 48 h after iodination reveal no change in the relative distribution of radioactivity, indicating similar rates of degradation for most of the labeled membrane proteins. The fate of the labeled membrane proteins was studied at various times after phagocytosis of nondigestible polystyrene particles. Iodinated L cells phagocytose sufficient 1.1 mum latex beads in 60 min to interiorize 15-30% of the total cell surface area. Electron microscope autoradiography confirmed that labeled membrane is internalized during phagocytosis. The latex-containing phagocytic vacuoles are isolated by flotation in a discontinuous sucrose gradient. 15-30% of the total incorporated label and a comparable percentage of alkaline phosphodiesterase I activity (PDase, a plasma membrane enzyme marker) are recovered in the phagocytic vacuole fraction. Lysosomal enzyme activities are found in the latex vacuole fraction, indicating formation of phagolysosomes. SDS gel analyses reveal that all of the radioactive proteins initially present on the intact cell's surface are interiorized to the same relative extent. Incorporated label and PDase activity disappear much more rapidly from the phagolysosomes than from the whole cell. In the phagolysosomal compartment, greater than 70% of the TCA-precipitable labeled proteins and all of the PDase activity are lost rapidly (t1/2 equals 1-2 h) but similar 30% of the labeled proteins in this compartment are degraded with a 17-20 h half-life. The slowly degraded label is due to specific long-lived polypeptides, of 85,000 and 8,000-15,000 daltons, which remain in the phagolysosomal membrane up to 40 h after phagocytosis.

163840|a|To evaluate the usefulness of blood testosterone (T) in monitoring the effects of therapy in congenital virilizing adrenal hyperplasia due to 21- or 11- hydroxylation defect (CVAH), T levels were measured on 45 occasions in 13 patients with CVAH; 32 urinary 17-ketosteroid levels and 31 preganetriol values were available for comparison. Bone age levels, growth data, and medication are listed to help assess the clinical state of the patient at the time of each T determination. Blood T values were above normal for age and sex in untreated patients with CVAH and declined with glucocorticoid suppression. A blood T value of 20 ng/100 ml appeared to distinguish between well-controlled cases and those with inadequate steroid suppression. Serial measurement of blood T in girls and in prepubertal boys with CVAH provides assistance in evaluating chemical control of the disease, particularly when accurate 24-h urine collections cannot be obtained for 17-ketosteroid and pregnanetriol assessments.

163841|t|Interaction of delta-5-androstene-3beta, 17beta-diol with estradiol and dihydrotestosterone receptors in human myometrial and mammary cancer tissue.
163841|a|Specific receptor binding of estradiol (E-2) and dihydrotestosterone  (DHT) was studied in human myometrial tissue and in human mammary cancer tissue. The inhibition of binding for E-2 and DHT by E-2, testosterone (T), DHT, dehydroepiandosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), androstendione (A) and 5-androstene-3beta, 17beta-diol (Adiol) was tested with the use of dextran-coated charcoal separation of bound and free E-2, respectively, and DHT. The percentage of binding inhibition was calculated with reference to the inhibition obtained with nafoxidine in a molar concentration ratio of 1,000 for E-2 binding, respectively, with cyproterone acetate in a molar concentration ratio of 10,000 for DHT binding. In 15 samples of myometrium tested, receptors were found for both E-2 and DHT. From 19 samples of mammary carcinoma tissue one showed no binding activity, three samples did bind E-2 only, five samples DHT only, and ten samples showed binding of both steroids. A 50% inhibition of E-2 binding, in myometrial as well as in tumor tissue, required a molar concentration ratio of 40 for Adiol, of more than 2,000 for DHEA. No significant inhibiting activity could be found for A up to a molar concentration ratio of 10,000 and for DHEA-S up to 40,000. With regard to DHT binding, Adiol is more active than E-2 and less active than T. Of the substances tested Adiol is therefore the only one which exerts a significant inhibiting influence at a molar ratio not far beyond the physiological range. This signifies that Adiol might interfere at the receptor level in the estrogenic stimulation of mammary cancer cells.

163842|t|Regulation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secretion by serum and dibutyryl cyclic AMP in malignant trophoblast cells in vitro.
163842|a|Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) secretion was studied in human malignant trophoblast cells (Jar line) in continuous culture. Radioimmunoassayable hCG in the cells and in the daily culture fluid was increased for at least 3 days by 10% newborn calf serum and by 1 mN N-6, 0-2'-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphoric acid (dbcAMP) plus 1 mM theorphylline. Incubation of the cells in the presence of serum, dbcAMP and theorphylline resulted in additive stimulation of hCG secretion after 1 day. After 2 or 3 days, a supra-additive stimulation was observed, which was prevented by Actinomycin D. When cells were preincubated for 2 days in the absence of serum but with dbcAMP plus theorphylline, subsequent addition of serum resulted in supra-additive stimulation of hCG secretion within a single day; the continued presence of dbcAMP plus theophylline was not necessary for this stimulation by serum. These findings suggested that dbcAMP activates a slow process requiring RNA synthesis, resulting in increased hCG secretion. Serum appears to protect the hCG synthesizing system from degradation.

163843|t|Immunochemical heterogeneity of calcitonin in plasma.
163843|a|Calcitonin was measured in the plasma of 13 patients with medullary throid carcinoma and one patient with a calcitonin-producing islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas. The hormone was measured by the simultaneous application of two calcitonin antisera which had differing specificity. Calcitonin measurements were also made of gel filtration (Bio Gel P30) fractions of plasma samples. Although the two antisera were of comparable sensitivity for the measurement of human calcitonin standards, they reacted differently with the calcitonin in the plasma samples. One antiserum (LD-1) gave consistently higher estimations of hormone concentration in the plasma of patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma than the other (LD-26). By contrast, the concentration of calcitonin from the islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas was higher in the LD-26 assay. Multiple gel filtration peaks of immunoreactive calcitonin activity were present in both thyroidal and nonthyroidal calcitonin. Furthermore, the two different antisera identified differing immunochemical peaks of calcitonin activity for agiven plasma sample. These findings demonstrate the presence of immunochemical heterogeneity in plasma calcitonin and suggest the presence of immunological differences between thyroidal and nonthyroidal calcitonin.
