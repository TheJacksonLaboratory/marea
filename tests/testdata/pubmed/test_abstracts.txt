Until recently, treatment has continued at a relatively unsophisticated level. Although amputation, usually at a cross-bone level with a safe margin above the lesion, continues to be the treatment of choice, increased interest is being demonstrated in radical en bloc limb-saving resections. Modern joint implants are proving effective in restoring the osseous integrity and joint function after the resection.

Flow rates of oxygen into the bag were varied: 5, 10, 15, and 20 liter/min. For each flow rate, bag refill (reexpansion) times were varied: 1, 2, 4 sec. The results show that such a maneuver will effectively increase the FDO2 of the bags at all flow rates tested--in certain instances to values greater than 0.8. This maneuver would be important to resuscitation situations where it is desirable to achieve better patient oxygenation.

This system was used successfully during transportation of 6 of 11 patients who required ventilatory assistance and who were being considered for extracorporeal membrane oxygenator support. Immediately after transportation, PaCO2 values were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients ventilated with this system, when compared to PaCO2 values of the remaining 5 patients in whom ventilation was assisted with a 2-liter anesthesia bag (PaCO2 = 58.7 +/- 3.6). This system offers significant advantages over other presently manufactured systems, including low cost, portability, and efficiency in terms of oxygen utilization. (Manual ventilation is supplied so that no auxiliary electrical power supply is necessary.) Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can be varied by 2.5 cm H2O increments using a commercially available, weighted ball valve. In addition, it has been useful for transporting patients with acute respiratory failure within the hospital for therapeutic maneuvers or diagnostic studies.

The rapidity with which this occurs seems to depend on the quantity and quality of patient secretions and dumping infected water from lazy loops into the Humidifier. Following modifications to the ventilator circuit which included: (1) closed system humidifier filling, (2) the addition of a small copper trap and drainage system to the inspired side of the breathing circuit, and (3) alteration of the heater, no contamination of the humidifier contents occurred for periods as long as 28 days. This trap was manufactured in our hospital using standard plumbing fixtures; a commercial model is available. This system is applicable to any volume ventilator using a heated reservoir humidifier.

Persistent asymptomatic lesions in any portion of the oral cavity, except the lip, that were considered clinically suspicious with our previous criteria (erythroplasia), or those changes that did not correspond to the visual criteria but were found in high risk sites, were studied and biopsies were performed. Degrees of redness versus whiteness and clinical diagnoses were documented. Of 148 lesions in 113 patients, 66 were malignant (52 invasive and 14 in situ). There was a false negative diagnostic rate of 4.5% (3 of 66) and a false positive rate of 7% (4 of 57). Of the malignant lesions, 86.3% were primarily red compared with 31.9% of the benign lesions. OF the cancers, 10.7% were predominantly white as opposed to 66.7% of benign lesions. This analysis confirms our previous suppositions that persistent erythroplasia rather than leukoplakia, in high-risk sites of the oral cavity, is the earliest and predominant sign of oral carcinoma.

The rationale for oral cytology is developed and documented, and interpretations of the results are explained. Advantages and disadvantages of this technique are given and indications and contraindications for this diagnostic adjunct are discussed. A simple method involving the use of inexpensive equipment in the office is suggested.

The concept of "illness behavior" can be used to investigate this problem. Knowledge of a patient's illness behavior patterns helps enable the dentist to understand who seeks care for symptoms of facial pain and mandibular dysfunction; why the care is sought; the meaning of the symptoms to the patient; and the patient's response to treatment.

The cleanser caused a significantly (P less than .01) greater intensity and incidence (P less than .01) of inflammation. The added insult from cleanser pretreatment caused destruction of the odontoblast processes withnin the cut dentinal tubules, and an increase in diameter of the tubules. These effects on dentin and odontoblasts probably contributed to the observed increase in adverse pulp responses.

Those receiving biofeedback were able to reduce their mean masseter EMG levels significantly. Concurrently, there was a reduction of symptoms. Seventy-five percent of the successfully treated patients required no further therapy during one year of observation.

Psychologicall, the patient felt better by knowing that the mass was completely removed. Atherosclerosis should be considered when masses are found in the lips in elderly patients. It is thought that this lesion is common but has not been reported in the past.

Those authorized in 1972 and 1976 were surveyed only once, in 1972 and 1977, respectively. The response rate was always higher than 89%. Urban/rural and regional maldistribution of civilian dentists was reduced during the years 1972-1977 (Tables 1-7). The dentist/population ratio fails to allow for variation in need and demand for dental care, the use of ancillary personnel, demographic, socio-economic and cultural factors. Consequently, care should be exercised when judging the adequacy or otherwise of the supply of dentists by these results. The proportion of respondents whose place of work and home address at the start of dental studies, was the same county, increased during the observation period (Fig. 1), when in fact an opposite trend had been expected because of the progressively more difficult job situation for newly authorized dentists. It was concluded that this tendency to return "home" might be made use of in the efforts to make dental health services equally available and accessible to all citizens.

Such systems show significant cooperativity in their binding of O2: at low O2 pressures a low O2 affinity form exists, and at high O2 pressures a higher O2 affinity form develops. Direct analogies are drawn to the cooperativity shown in O2 binding by hemoglobin. These model systems mimic hemoglobin quantitatively.

The replacement of the distal valine by alanine in hemoglobin Sydney leaves a large gap inside the heme pocket, which is partly filled by a water molecule bonded to the distal histidine. Hemoglobin Sydney has the same partition coefficient between CO and O2 as hemoglobin A. Replacement of the distal histidine increases the stretching frequency of CO linked to the beta heme by 6 cm-1, but replacement of the distal valine increases it by only 3 cm-1, but replacement of the distal histidine leaves the O-O stretching frequency unchanged.

Chain termination and "plus and minus" DNA sequencing methods have been used to obtain the nucleotide sequence of these two origins. The unique origin at which the complementary DNA strand is initiated has located in the untranslated region between genes F and G. This sequence, which has considerable secondary structure, contains a stretch which is complementary to the RNA primer that is observed during synthesis in vitro of the G4 complementary DNA strand [Bouché, J.P., Rowen, L. & Kornberg, A. (1978) J. Biol. Chem., in press]. This G4 origin shows extensive sequence homology with the bacteriophage lambda origin of DNA replication [Denniston-Thompson, K., Moore, D. D., Kruger, D. E., Furth, M. E. & Blattner, F. R. (1977) Science 198, 1051-1056]. The sequence around the site in gene A at which G4 viral DNA strand synthesis is initiated by the nicking action of the cistron A protein is very similar to that of bacteriophage phiX174. An (A + T)-rich stretch flanked by (G + C)-rich sequences may be involved in the interaction between the DNA and protein.

Reduction of this bond in the native protein requires approximately 50-fold more mercaptoethanol than the reduction of the bond in the protein denatured by sodium dodecyl sulfate. An improved procedure for the formation of this disulfide bond from recombined chains is reported. A and B chains spontaneously and rapidly reassociate into a stable complex with a sedimentation velocity similar to that of native oxidized ricin before the disulfide bond reforms. The mixture of both chains also behaves on Bio-Gel P-100 like native oxidized ricin. However, the complex formed by the two chains, assayed before the disulfide bond can reform, and reduced ricin, carboxymethylated to prevent reoxidation, shows a significant decrease in toxicity to mice and a decrease in ability to inhibit protein synthesis in HeLa cells in culture.

The present paper is concerned with a number of examples of enzyme--enzyme interactions that do not belong to the class of models of the earlier papers. These are more biochemically oriented and include heterologous dimers, a linear chain with unsymmetrical interactions, and concerted isologous dimers (half-the-sites reactivity).

Although complete sequences have not been established, the following characteristics are apparent. (a) Cytoplasmic actins are the products of two different genes. The difference seen in isoelectric focusing studies is probably determined only by the nature of the three amino-terminal acidic residues. (b) Mammalian cytoplasmic actins are exceedingly similar and perhaps identical. (c) Cytoplasmic actins may differ by at least 25 amino acid replacement from rabbit muscle actin. These replacements have been identified for calf thymus actin; however, other cytoplasmic actins show the same replacements. (d) The replacements always involve-except for the first five residues-neutral amino acid residues. (e) The replacements are not randomly distributed. Residues 18-75 are constant whereas residues 2-18 and 259-298 show many substitutions. (f) The main component of smooth muscle actin from chicken gizzard shows the charge characteristics found at the amino terminus of the less acidic cytoplasmic actin species. In the rest of the polypeptide chain, gizzard actin resembles skeletal muscle actin, although two substitutions of the cytoplasmic type have been identified. (g) Heart muscle actin is very similar to skeletal muscle actin. Only two amino acid replacements have been found; they are of the cytoplasmic type. (h) Skeletal muscle actins from chicken and beef have not shown a replacement.

From rat liver nuclei that had been incubated with NAD+, histones and some nonhistone proteins were extracted with 0.25 M HCl. Approximately 60% of the ADP-ribose incorporated into 20% trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was recovered in this extract. The ADP-ribosylated material was then isolated from the extract by covalent chromatography on a borate gel column and further purified by carboxymethylcellulose column chromatography. As judged by electrophoretic mobilities in various gel systems and by amino acid compositions, approximately 50% of the ADP-ribose recovered in the carboxymethylcellulose fractions was associated with several nonhistone proteins with molecular weights of 2-6 x 10(4), while 35% aand 15% were associated with histones H2B and H1, respectively. Since the average chain length of the polymer bound to any of these proteins was less than two ADP-ribos-l units, the percentage distribution reflects the number of ADP-ribosylated sites rather than the chain length.

The 32P-labeled 19S and 26S RNA hybridized to DNA from nucleosome monomers, dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers, separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, although the level of hybridization to DNA from nucleosome fractions was less than the level of hybridization to undigested nuclear DNA. The distribution of 19S and 26S rDNA sequences in the nucleosome fractions differed from the distribution of bulk DNA in that the rDNA sequences were recovered primarily in two fractions containing monomer-sized DNA lengths (140-160 base pairs). The percentage of DNA hybridizing to 19S plus 26S RNA was greater in peak A, the more slowly sedimenting monomer peak, than in any other chromatin fraction at all stages of digestion. Peak A and monomer particles differed in protein content and distribution. The presence of ribosomal cistrons in an altered nucleosome configuration may be related to changes in functional states of rDNA chromatin.

The inhibitor is associated with a cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activity (ATP:protein phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.37) that phosphorylates the small polypeptide (38,000 daltons) of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2. Activation of the inhibitor requires ATP in addition to double-stranded RNA and is accompanied by the phosphorylation of a 67,000-dalton polypeptide of unknown function. The inhibitor remains associated with the ribosomes during high-speed sedimentation. Once formed, the ribosome-associated inhibitor phosphorylates eIF-2 and inhibits protein synthesis in the absence of double-stranded RNA. Inhibition is prevented by exogenous eIF-2. The bound inhibitor can be solubilized by extraction with 0.5 M KCl. The soluble inhibitor preparation retains the ability to phosphorylate the small polypeptide of eIF-2 and to inhibit protein synthesis. Untreated crude ribosomes also contain cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activities that phosphorylate the middle polypeptide (49,000 daltons) of eIF-2 and several polypeptide subunits of eIF-3 (160,000, 125,000, and 65,000 daltons); these kinase activities are not affected by double-stranded RNA and do not inhibit protein synthesis.

The molecular weight calculated on the basis of the sequence is 5928. The whole chain is homologous with the region between positions 75 and 121 from concanavalin A. The NH2-terminal sequence of the beta chain, determined by automated Edman degradation, is homologous to another portion of the concanavalin A molecule, between positions 123 and 165. Comparison of the 94 residues from the lentil lectin alpha and beta chains with concanavalin A reveals the existence of 43 identities. Thirty-four other homologies could have arisen, each by a single nucleotide substitution. This extensive homology suggests that the lentil lectin alpha and beta chains may be proteolytic fragments from a single polypeptide chain of the same length as concanavalin A.

Cells arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle showed increased incorporation of exogenous adenosine into their adenine nucleotide pools as compared with growing cells. This phenomenon is unexpected because salvage pathways from all other preformed nucleosides and bases as well as the de novo synthesis of adenine nucleotides is decreased after arrest of growth by serum deprivation. The incorporation of adenosine into adenine nucleotides may serve as an intracellular signal in the regulation of growth in mammalian cells.

A compound soluble in chloroform/methanol/water, 1:1:0.3 (vol/vol), was found that was indistinguishable from the previously described glucose-containing dolichyl diphosphate oligosaccharide formed by liver microsomes. Glycopeptides were prepared by treating the glycoproteins with pronase, the amino acids were removed with alkaline borohydride, and the products were examined by paper electrophoresis and chromatography. A saccharide equal to that which occurs in the glucose-containing dolichyl diphosphate oligosaccharide could not be detected but glucose was found in oligosaccharides that seemed to be smaller by about three to five monosaccharide residues. The same results were obtained by direct treatment of the glycoproteins with alkaline borohydride.

The same activity was detected in extracts of cells treated with mock preparations of interferon, but at <0.3% of the level found in interferon-treated cell extracts. The enzyme was activated by double-stranded RNA and could be isolated by binding to columns of poly(I)-poly(C)-agarose. In the column-bound state, the enzyme reacted with ATP to synthesize the inhibitor, which could then be continuously eluted from the column. The inhibitor was purified and its structure and function were compared with those of the low molecular weight inhibitor of protein synthesis made by an enzyme from interferon-treated mouse L cells. The avian and mammalian inhibitors comigrated on thin layers of polyethyleneimine-cellulose during chromatography in three different solvent systems, and they coeluted as a series of peaks from columns of DEAE-cellulose during sodium chloride gradient elution. Digestion with bacterial alkaline phosphatase or snake venom phosphodiesterase yielded products that similarly comigrated. Functionally, the two inhibitors were interchangeable: both inhibited protein synthesis in extracts of mammalian and avian cells, producing 50% inhibition at a concentration of about 0.3 nM (AMP equivalents). We conclude that the chick cell-derived oligonucleotide inhibitor has a structure that is closely related or identical to that of the inhibitor made in the mouse system, and that both preparations inhibit cell-free protein synthesis in a non-species-specific manner.

This protein was studied because it contains a single indole side chain which is deeply buried in an expandable oily region and because the phosphorescence of the homologous indole in bovine serum albumin could not be detected at ambient temperatures. The transient was identified on the following basis: (i) its triplet-triplet absorption spectrum was similar to those previously reported for indole and tryptophan; (ii) it was quenched by small quantities of oxygen; and (iii) it was photobleached by 370- to 700-nm light. In a nitrogen-saturated solution at room temperature, the indole triplet decays exponentially for more than a factor of 10 with a lifetime of 0.5 msec. These observations suggest that, because of its exponential decay and relatively long lifetime, the triplet will be more valuable than the indole singlet as an intrinsic reporter group for the study of the structure and dynamics of proteins in solution.

The newly synthesized RNA can be resolved by gel electrophoresis into a few predominant 4S RNA species and a series of slower migrating components. One of the 4S RNA species appears to be identical, by fingerprint analysis, to the tRNAMet1 isolated by hybridization of somatic cell RNA to this cloned tRNA gene fragment (tDNA). Thus, the tRNAMet1 produced after injection can be both fully processed and modified. Its rate of synthesis is estimated to be about 6 x 10(9) molecules/hr in each oocyte injected with 2 ng of tDNA. When the tDNA fragment is cleaved into two halves with restriction endonuclease Sst I, each injected half gives rise to a subset of the RNAs produced after injection of the intact fragment. This experiment thus suggests the presence of at least two transcriptional units on this cloned tDNA. This simple way of biologically testing defined restriction fragments may be of value for analyzing the functional organization of other cloned eukaryotic DNA units.

Purified alpha-, beta-, and gamma-crystallins have low D/L ratios. Fractionation of urea-solubilized material from the water-insoluble protein yields four molecular weight classes of proteins. Fractions representing crosslinked material or apparently degraded products have high D/L ratios. Racemization within lens proteins may contribute to formation of the water-insoluble fraction seen in aging lenses and cataracts.

Ligandin retained its capacity to bind bilirubin in the presence of components of liver supernatant, but albumin, which binds bilirubin in serum, lost the capacity to bind bilirubin in liver supernatant. This was attributed to a greater binding specificity exhibited by ligandin. In their respective physiological milieus, albumin and ligandin are structurally adapted to bind ligands: albumin in serum, and ligandin in the cytosol of the liver cell. These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that the concentration of ligandin within the liver could regulate the net flux of certain organic anions from plasma into the liver.

Using hybridization of globin cDNA to globin mRNA as a model system, we found that equivalent amounts of cDNA were required both for the saturation of the mRNA hybridization and for complete inhibition of globin synthesis. Also, the rate of inactivation of translation was identical to the rate of hybridization and followed the predicted kinetic form. This assay has been applied to the analysis of a set of abundant mRNAs in mouse liver. Hybridization of liver mRNA with total liver cDNA in slight excess to a low C(0)t value specifically inhibited translation of several major polypeptides. Melting of the hybrids prior to translation restored synthesis of these polypeptides. Moreover, we found that different liver mRNAs are inactivated with different kinetics; the results suggest that the mRNAs for the major urinary polypeptide and for albumin are the most abundant and second most abundant, respectively, in mouse liver. The general applications of this technique are discussed.

The fragments were separated on agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, hybridized to globin [(32)P]cDNA, and radioautographed. One to ten picograms of globin gene sequences were detectable. With EcoRI digestion, eight to nine cellular DNA fragments were found to contain globin genes. Three of these contained beta-like gene sequences assayed with beta globin cDNA probe. One beta-like fragment was absent in DNA from a homozygous subject for hemoglobin Lepore. Two of the three beta gene-containing fragments present in normal DNA were absent in DNA from a patient with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. The same two fragments containing beta-like genes were absent from deltabeta thalassemic DNA and one new fragment containing beta-like genes was found. Together with results obtained by hybridization of these DNAs in solution, the data are consistent with deletion of specific restriction human DNA fragments in subjects with these disorders and a greater deletion of beta-like gene sequences in subjects with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin than in those with deltabeta thalassemia.

The stereoselective synthesis makes use of the monolysocardiolipin 1-(3-sn-phosphatidyl)-3-[1-acyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero(3)phospho]-sn-glycerol, available from the stereospecific hydrolysis of cardiolipin by phospholipase A2 (phosphatide 2-acylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.4) of Trimeresurus flavoviridis. The results of treatment of the spin-labeled cardiolipin with the cardiolipin-specific phospholipase D (phosphatidylcholine phosphatidohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.4) (Hemophilus parainfluenzae) of known specificity and with phospholipase C (phosphatidylcholine cholinephosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.3) of Bacillus cereus are consistent with the assigned structure. The spin-labeled cardiolipin is further characterized and the unique features of this diastereomer are discussed in the context of the unusual stereochemistry of the natural phospholipid.

The reactions proceeded in equimolar concentrations of donors and acceptors. Several oligonucleotides of defined sequence were synthesized by this method in yields of 28-68%. The enzyme required the phosphate ester at the 3' position of the donor molecule, nucleoside 5',2'-diphosphates being unable to serve as donors. Thymidine 5',3'-diphosphate was active as a donor for the enzyme. The ligation product, (Ap)2ApCp, was also obtained from the reaction of (Ap)2A and 5'-adenylylated cytidine 5',3'-diphosphate (A5'pp5'Cp) with RNA ligase in the absence of ATP. These results show that the minimal substrate for RNA ligase is a nucleoside 5',3'-diphosphate.

N-Ethylmaleimide (10 mM) and iodoacetamide (1.5 mM) inhibited DNA polymerase-alpha activity completely, whereas only 35-40% inhibition was observed for DNA polymerase-beta under similar conditions. DNA polymerase-alpha activity was reduced 50-70% in N-18 cells that had been induced to differentiate by 4 micro M bromodeoxyuridine, and the low molecular weight DNA polymerase-beta activity remain unchanged. With activated calf thymus DNA as template, only DNA polymerase-alpha activity was stimulated in the presence of added ribonucleotides and purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase.

Treatment of genomic DNA with restriction endonucleases that do not cleave the ovalbumin mRNA sequence results in the generation of multiple DNA fragments capable of annealing with ovalbumin-specific probes in molecular hybridization reactions. These data strongly suggest that the linear order of DNA sequences coding for ovalbumin is interrupted by at least two intragenic DNA spacers absent from the corresponding RNA. At least one of these spacer sequences interrupts the coding sequence; therefore the chromosomal ovalbumin gene is not colinear with its translational product. We can discern no difference in the sequence organization about this gene in producer and nonproducer somatic cells, suggesting that the presence of intragenic spacers does not reflect that transcriptional activity of this gene. Furthermore, profiles obtained for gametes are identical to those observed for somatic cells, indicating that significant translocation during development is not responsible for the generation of this split sequence. Divergence of the intragenic spacer, however, is observed between individual chickens; thus multiple alleles may exist for this gene that are identifiable by differences in the organization of spacer with no apparent phenotypic evidence for their presence.

Correspondingly, the mature beta-globin mRNA appears to be synthesized via a 15S precursor, the length of which roughly equals the total length of the coding and intervening sequences of the beta-globin gene. Using the electron microscope to visualize hybrid structures formed between this gene and the purified 15S beta-globin mRNA precursor, we show that the intervening sequence is present within the larger precursor molecule. This finding suggests that the precursor mRNA is processed through the removal and rejoining of internal RNA sequences.

The thiomercuribenzoate derivatives bind selectively to wheat germ agglutinin in the same way as the corresponding sugars. Using the thiomercuribenzoate of di-N-acetyl-beta-chitobiose, it was found that: (i) the fluorescence of tryptophan residues was drastically quenched at both 298 and 77 K; (ii) the phosphorescence intensity was strongly enhanced at 77 K; (iii) the phosphorescence lifetime was markedly decreased. A similar effect was observed with the thiomercuribenzoate of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine. These changes were completely reversed upon addition of 1-O-methyl-di-N-acetyl-beta-chitobioside. The thiomercuribenzoate of beta-D-glucose had no effect at all, and the thiomercuribenzoate of tri-N-acetyl-beta-chitotriose had a limited effect. These results are interpreted as a specific heavy atom effect due to a close contact between one tryptophan residue of the protein and the heavy atom of the bound ligand. They are consistent with the view that: (i) binding sites of wheat germ agglutinin may be divided in three subsites, A, B, and C; (ii) a tryptophan residue is in the binding site at subsite C; and (iii) this residue and the ligand are in close contact. This new method, using the enhancement of spin-orbit coupling due to the selective perturbation induced in a tryptophan residue by a ligand containing a heavy atom, has proved to be suitable for locating the tryptophan residue in the binding site of wheat germ agglutinin and can probably be extended to other sugar-binding proteins.

Heritable genetic changes that affect a pair of matching populations can be evolutionary only when this matching quality is not disrupted. We distinguish two types of heritable change. Concordant heritable changes autonomously preserve the match and are thus automatically candidates for what we call type I evolutionary change. Nonconcordant heritable changes, on the other hand, are those that do not autonomously preserve the match. Those nonconcordant heritable changes that can use other normally present ontogenetic mechanisms to preserve the match are candidates for what we call type II evolutionary change. One example of such an ontogenetic mechanism consists of the production of excess neuroblasts and the subsequent weeding out (via cell death) of those that do not successfully match. Because normal ontogeny is an integral part of type II evolutionary change, ontogenetic manipulations can give evolutionary insights. Embryonic graft experiments, in particular, can elucidate the nature of ontogenetic mechanisms that participate in type II changes. Thus, some developmental experiments can be considered to be evolutionary experiments.

The resultant colony size distribution is an accurate indicator of the number of subsequent in vitro population doublings that can be attained by the parent culture. This relationship holds for both human fetal lung and adult skin fibroblast cultures. In addition, the colony size distributions obtained from fetal, young adult, and old adult human cell cultures at the same low level of in vitro passage are indicative of the in vivo age of the level of in vitro passage are indicative of the in vivo age of the cell culture donor. Cell cultures of fetal origin give rise to the highest percentage of colonies with significant proliferative abilities, whereas cultures from old adults give rise to the lowest percentage of large colonies. Therefore, colony size distributions appear to be good indicators of both in vitro and in vivo human cellular aging.

This process is called capping. Here, a novel explanation of such a process is presented in which the membrane is viewed as a supersaturated solution of receptors in the lipid bilayer and the adjacent two aqueous layers. Without a crosslinking agent, a patch of receptors that is less than a certain size cannot stay in equilibrium with the solution and thus should dissolve. Patches greater than a certain size are stable and can, in principle, grow by the precipitation of the remaining dissolved receptors from the supersaturated solution. The task of the crosslinking molecules is to form such stable patches. These considerations are based on a qualitative thermodynamic calculation that takes into account the existence of a boundary tension in a patch (in analogy to the surface tension of a droplet). Thermodynamically, these systems should cap spontaneously after the patches have reached a certain size. But, in practice, such a process can be very slow. A suspension of patches may stay practically stable. The ways in which a cell may abolish this metastable equilibrium and thus achieve capping are considered and possible effects of capping inhibitors are discussed.
